  "question": "Give an example of a task where an encoder-only transformer utilizing a `[CLS]` token would be suitable.",
  "response": "Encoder-only transformer models are well-suited for tasks like sequence classification where the output is a single value. For these tasks, a special `[CLS]` token is prepended to the input sequence, and its corresponding output vector (ùëß‚ÇÅ) represents the entire sequence, used for computing the loss function.
