  "question": "What was the initial purpose for which the Transformer architecture was designed?",
  "response": "The Transformer architecture offers a powerful approach to both text representation and generation in NLP. It uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than recurrent networks. The Transformer's flexibility allows for various configurations tailored to specific tasks, including encoder-only models like BERT that excel at text representation, decoder-only models like GPT that are specialized for text generation, and Seq2Seq models that combine encoder and decoder components for tasks requiring mapping input sequences to output sequences.",
