  "question": "Besides the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), what other machine learning classifiers could be suitable for text classification after the pre-processing steps described?",
  "response": "Besides Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), several other machine learning classifiers are suitable for text classification after the specified pre-processing steps, including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The document mentions that after converting text into a numerical vector format using methods like TF-IDF, common ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks can be trained to learn the relationship between text features and class labels.",
