  "question": "What makes Multimodal T5 distinct from the other T5 variants mentioned in the table?",
  "response": "Multimodal T5 is a T5 variant designed for vision-language tasks, allowing it to process both text and image inputs. This contrasts with other T5 variants such as mT5, which focuses on multilingual NLP; Flan-T5, which excels at instruction-following; ByT5, which foregoes tokenization; T5-3B/11B, which are high-capacity models for complex tasks; UL2, which uses unified objectives for versatility; and Efficient T5, which is designed for resource-constrained environments. Multimodal T5's key strength lies in its ability to handle both text and image data, but this also makes it computationally intensive.",
