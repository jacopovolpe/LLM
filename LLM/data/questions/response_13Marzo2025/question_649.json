The lesson also discusses machine learning-based classification, which involves converting text into a numerical vector format, training a model using a labeled dataset, and applying the trained model to classify new documents. The Reuters 21578 dataset is presented as a real-world example of multi-class and multi-label text classification. The course content also includes text classification and clustering using TF-IDF vectors, as well as neural networks for text analysis, including CNNs, recurrent networks, and LSTMs. Furthermore, the course covers encoder-only models for sentence classification and named entity recognition.",
