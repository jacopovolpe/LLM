  "question": "Which library is mentioned for practical implementation guidance in the context of RLHF?",
  "response": "For implementing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) library is highly recommended. TRL is specifically designed for training Transformer language models using reinforcement learning and provides tools for supervised fine-tuning, reward model training, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). It also integrates seamlessly with the Hugging Face Transformers library. You can explore the TRL library on Hugging Face at [https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.7.8/index](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.7.8/index).",
