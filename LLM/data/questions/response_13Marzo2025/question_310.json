  "question": "Explain the concept of cross-entropy loss and its role in the training of GPT models.",
  "response": "GPT models are pre-trained using a next-token prediction objective, also known as autoregressive language modeling. During training, the models predict the next word (or token) in a sequence, learning contextual relationships and linguistic patterns. This training involves minimizing cross-entropy loss, using optimizers like Adam, and incorporating techniques like learning rate schedules and large batch sizes to enhance training stability and generalization.",
