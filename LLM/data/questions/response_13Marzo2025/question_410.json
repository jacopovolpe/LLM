  "question": "What specific aspects of the chosen tools and models should students be familiar with?",
  "response": "To ensure responsible LLM usage, it is important to choose appropriate guardrail techniques for your specific application and objectives. Start with simpler techniques and gradually add complexity if the desired results are not achieved. Thoroughly review the documentation of chosen frameworks to understand their functionalities and limitations, and examine existing examples provided in the documentation to learn from practical implementations. Finally, integrate the chosen guardrail techniques and frameworks into your project.\n\nWhile tools like Guardrails AI and LangChain offer functionalities for prompt management and basic filtering, they might not suffice for complex applications needing advanced filtering or protection against adversarial attacks. Combining rule-based systems, machine learning classifiers, and continuous monitoring is crucial for robust guardrails. Tools like SpaCy Matcher, ReLM patterns, and the LM evaluation harness can be used for sophisticated filtering and evaluation. Active learning and bug bounties help in continuously improving LLM guardrails.",
