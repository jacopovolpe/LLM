  "question": "How might the focus on open-source LLMs and their potential advantages in the \"Additional Context\" influence the development and application of prompt engineering techniques?",
  "response": "This course, designed for the Master's Degree Program in Computer Engineering at the University of Salerno, provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). Instructors Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco will guide students through fundamental NLP concepts, the Transformer architecture underlying LLMs, and practical applications such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning. The course aims to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in designing and implementing NLP systems using LLMs.\n\nThe course objectives are divided into knowledge acquisition and skill development. Students will learn basic concepts of NLP, including its history and core challenges, as well as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Generation (NLG). They will also explore statistical approaches to NLP and delve into Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers, including self-attention mechanisms and encoder-decoder structures. Furthermore, students will learn about NLP applications with LLMs, such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and chatbot development, along with prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques. Students will develop the ability to design and implement an NLP system based on LLMs, integrating existing technologies and tools like HuggingFace Transformers.\n\nThe Transformer architecture offers advantages such as self-attention, which captures long-range dependencies, scalability due to parallelizable computations, stackability for learning complex representations, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for efficient vocabulary handling, and positional encodings to account for word order.\n\nInstruction fine-tuning enhances LLMs by training them on (instruction, input, output) triples, improving their ability to generalize to new instructions and generate accurate responses.\n\nPrompt engineering is a discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs. It enhances understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, improves performance on tasks like question answering and reasoning, helps interfacing with LLMs, and enables new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge.\n\nSystem prompts are instructions provided to the AI model before any user interactions to establish initial context, desired behavior, tone, and special instructions. For example, a system prompt could establish the assistant's behavior, context, and tone, or guide the model on how to respond and what it should focus on.\n\nFine-tuning tailors a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on a relevant dataset, enhancing domain specialization, accuracy, and relevance, and enabling effective utilization of smaller datasets. Full fine-tuning updates all parameters but has computational costs and overfitting risks. Alternative strategies include Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), Instruction Fine-Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).\n\nPrompts can be designed to achieve various NLP tasks, including text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, code generation, and reasoning.",
