  "question": "What is the role of the pre-trained model when using adapters?",
  "response": "After pre-training, LLMs can be adapted to specific downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Fine-tuning adjusts the pre-trained model's weights using a smaller, task-specific dataset and gradient descent. This can involve fine-tuning the entire model, specific layers or utilizing parameter-efficient methods like adapters.",
