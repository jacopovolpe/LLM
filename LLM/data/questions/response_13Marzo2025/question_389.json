  "question": "How does T5 use prefixes to guide the model towards performing a specific downstream task?",
  "response": "T5 uses task-specific prefixes to guide the model towards the desired output format. For example, the prefix \"summarize:\" is used for summarization tasks, \"translate English to French:\" for translation tasks, and \"question:  context:\" for question answering tasks. These prefixes are prepended to the input text, and the entire sequence is fed into the T5 model.",
