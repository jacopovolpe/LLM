  "question": "What is the function of the Decoder in a Transformer model?",
  "response": "The Decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, using the contextualized representation generated by the encoder. At each step, the decoder considers the encoder's output and the previously generated words in the output sequence. The decoder block structure mirrors the encoder block, with the addition of a second multi-head attention mechanism called encoder-decoder attention. A key difference from the encoder's self-attention is the \"masked\" self-attention within the decoder, which prevents the decoder from attending to future positions in the output sequence during training. The final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function, which projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, producing a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence.",
