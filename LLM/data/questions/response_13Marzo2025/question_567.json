  "question": "How does the use of a reward model in RLHF help address the limitations of traditional LLM training that relies solely on large text corpora?",
  "response": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) addresses the limitations of traditional Large Language Model (LLM) training, which often relies on large text corpora and can lead to factually incorrect, biased, or unsafe outputs. RLHF directly incorporates human judgment into the training process, resulting in models that are not only proficient in generating text but also better aligned with human expectations regarding safety, ethical considerations, and overall user satisfaction. A key component of RLHF is the reward model, a secondary model trained to evaluate the quality of LLM outputs by predicting human preference scores based on feedback provided on different generated outputs for the same prompt. The training data for a reward model consists of multiple LLM-generated outputs for a set of given prompts, along with corresponding human rankings or comparisons of these outputs, reflecting preferences based on criteria such as factual accuracy, coherence, relevance, and safety. The reward model's scores serve as the reinforcement signal, guiding the LLM towards generating outputs that align with human preferences.",
