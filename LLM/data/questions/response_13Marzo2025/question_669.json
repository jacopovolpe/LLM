  "question": "What is the key difference between single-label and multi-label classification?",
  "response": "In single-label classification, each document is assigned to only one class, which is suitable when categories are mutually exclusive. Binary classification is a special case of single-label classification with two classes. In contrast, multi-label classification allows a document to belong to multiple classes simultaneously, acknowledging that documents can address multiple topics or themes.",
