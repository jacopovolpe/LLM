  "question": "How does the scalability of Transformers, combined with the parallelizability of attention, contribute to the development of large language models (LLMs)?",
  "response": "The scalability of the Transformer architecture and the parallelizability of its attention mechanism have significantly impacted the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). The parallelizable nature of attention computations, combined with the lack of recurrence, allows Transformers to be scaled to much larger datasets and model sizes than RNNs or CNNs. This scalability has been instrumental in the development of large language models. Because each block maintains the same output dimensionality as the input, the encoder's design allows for stacking multiple encoder blocks. The output of one block becomes the input to the next, enabling the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input sequence.",
