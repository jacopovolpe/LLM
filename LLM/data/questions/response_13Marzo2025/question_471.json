  "question": "What are the four key elements of a well-structured prompt for a Large Language Model?",
  "response": "Crafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction, and several guidelines can help elicit desired outputs. It's best to start with simple prompts and gradually add elements while iterating and refining to improve results. Using clear, specific instructions such as \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" or \"Summarize\" at the beginning of prompts is also beneficial. Providing detailed and descriptive information can lead to better outcomes, and examples can guide the modelâ€™s output through few-shot learning. Balancing detail and length is important, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness.\n\nA well-structured prompt typically includes an instruction, which is a specific task; context, which is external information; input data, which is the question; and an output indicator, which specifies the format of the output.\n\nIn-context learning is a powerful capability where LLMs learn to perform a task by interpreting information within the prompt, which may specify reference material, input-output pairs, step-by-step instructions, clarifications, or templates.\n\nPrompts can be designed for various NLP tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, and code generation.\n\nSystem prompts, provided before user interactions, establish the initial context, desired behavior, tone, and special instructions for the LLM. Examples of system prompts include defining the assistant as helpful and knowledgeable, specializing in IT support, or adopting a friendly and engaging tone.",
