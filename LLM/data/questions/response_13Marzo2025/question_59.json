  "question": "What is the significance of the encoder blocks being \"identical\"?",
  "response": "The encoder in a Transformer model transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation. It consists of stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer. The encoder processes all input tokens in parallel, which is a key advantage over sequential RNNs.",
