  "question": "What is the key advantage of BPE in handling out-of-vocabulary words?",
  "response": "Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) plays a critical role in handling large vocabularies efficiently by representing words as subword units. This helps reduce the vocabulary size and addresses the out-of-vocabulary problem. BERT employs the WordPiece tokenizer, a subword tokenization method, to process input text. WordPiece breaks words into smaller units (subwords), allowing BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words and efficiently represent a wide range of vocabulary with a smaller vocabulary size.  Common words are treated as single tokens, while rarer words are split into constituent subwords. A key advantage of WordPiece embedding is that it facilitates the representation of rare or unknown words by breaking them into known subwords.",
