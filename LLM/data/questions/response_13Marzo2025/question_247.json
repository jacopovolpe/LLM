  "question": "How is the `[CLS]` token used for single-sentence classification tasks like sentiment analysis?",
  "response": "The `[CLS]` token, which is prepended to every input sequence in BERT, serves as an aggregate representation of the entire sequence. After processing the input, BERT's final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context of the sequence. For single-sentence classification tasks like sentiment analysis, the `[CLS]` embedding is directly fed into a classifier.",
