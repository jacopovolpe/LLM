  "question": "Name two common optimizers used for training models like LLaMA.",
  "response": "LLaMA, like GPT, undergoes pre-training using autoregressive language modeling. This involves training the model to predict the next token in a sequence. The training process minimizes cross-entropy loss, typically using optimizers like SGD or Adam, along with techniques such as gradient clipping, mixed precision training, learning rate schedules, and weight decay.",
