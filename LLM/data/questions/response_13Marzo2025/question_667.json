  "question": "How does binary classification differ from single-label classification?",
  "response": "Binary classification is a specific type of single-label classification. In binary classification, there are only two possible classes, simplifying the problem to a yes/no decision about a single category. Single-label classification, on the other hand, assigns each document to exactly one class, and is most appropriate when categories are mutually exclusive.",
