  "question": "How are output vectors obtained in an encoder-only transformer when the input and output sequences have the same length?",
  "response": "When an encoder-only Transformer model is used for tasks where the input and output sequences have the same length, the output vectors (z₁, ..., zₜ) are derived directly from the encoder, allowing for direct loss computation. Examples of such tasks include part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition.",
