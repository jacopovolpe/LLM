  "question": "Why is prompt testing important?",
  "response": "Prompt engineering is a new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications and research areas. Prompt engineering helps to improve LLM performance on a broad range of tasks, enhance understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, help in interfacing with LLMs and integrating with other tools, and enable new capabilities, such as augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external resources. Testing and iterating on prompts is an important aspect of prompt engineering.",
