  "question": "Give two examples of how system prompts can establish different personas for an AI assistant.",
  "response": "System prompts are instructions given to the AI model before any user interaction, establishing the initial context and desired behavior, shaping its subsequent responses. They can establish the assistant's behavior, context, tone, and any special instructions, setting the overall persona and style.\n\nTwo specific examples of system prompts creating distinct AI assistant personas are:\n\n1.  \"You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant who answers questions accurately and concisely.\" This promotes helpful and concise responses.\n2.  \"You are an IT support assistant specializing in troubleshooting software and hardware issues. Respond politely and guide users through step-by-step solutions.\" This establishes a specific persona and response style for IT support.",
