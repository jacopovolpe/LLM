  "question": "What specific prompt engineering techniques are anticipated to be discussed in the next part, considering the provided \"Additional Context\"?",
  "response": "Prompts can be designed for various NLP tasks, including text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, code generation, and reasoning.\n\nSystem prompts are instructions given to the AI model before any user interaction to establish context and desired behavior, shaping subsequent responses. They can establish the assistant's behavior, context, and tone, guiding the model on how to respond and what to focus on. For example, a system prompt could be \"You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant who answers questions accurately and concisely,\" or \"You are an IT support assistant specializing in troubleshooting software and hardware issues. Respond politely and guide users through step-by-step solutions,\" or even \"You are a friendly and engaging AI who responds in a warm and conversational tone, keeping responses lighthearted and approachable.\"\n\nInstruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and respond to user instructions by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples. The training dataset consists of an instruction, optional context, and the desired output.\n\nPrompt engineering is a discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications and research areas. The goals of prompt engineering are to enhance understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, improve LLM performance on tasks like question answering and arithmetic reasoning, help interface with LLMs and integrate with other tools, and enable new capabilities such as augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external resources.\n\nA well-structured prompt typically comprises an instruction, context, input data, and an output indicator. For instance, an example includes the instruction to classify text into neutral, negative, or positive, with the input data being the text \"I think the vacation is okay,\" and the output indicator being \"Sentiment:\".\n\nIn-context learning is a capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting and leveraging information provided directly within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters. A prompt context for in-context learning may specify reference material, input-output pairs, step-by-step instructions, clarifications, and templates.\n\nTechniques for adding guardrails to LLMs include rule-based filters, fine-tuning with custom data, prompt engineering, external validation layers, and real-time monitoring and feedback. Combining multiple techniques often yields the most robust safeguards. Specialized frameworks such as Guardrails AI, LangChain, and OpenAI Moderation simplify the implementation of guardrails, offering pre-built functionalities and easy integration with LLM APIs. Guardrails AI provides tools for validation, formatting, and filtering LLM outputs. LangChain enables chaining prompts and integrating validation and filtering steps into the LLM workflow, and is integrable with Guardrails.",
