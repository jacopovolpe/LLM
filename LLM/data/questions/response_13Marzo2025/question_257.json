  "question": "How does fine-tuning adapt BERT's pre-trained language model to a specific downstream task?",
  "response": "After pre-training, BERT is fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks by adding task-specific layers on top of the encoder output. The pre-trained weights can be either frozen or further updated during fine-tuning. The process involves minimizing the cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual labels for the given task, allowing BERT's general language understanding to adapt to specific application domains. The `[CLS]` token's representation is crucial during fine-tuning as it gets specifically trained to capture the nuances required for the target task.",
