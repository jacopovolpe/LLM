  "question": "In what ways can RLHF enhance the quality and informativeness of text summarization?",
  "response": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can enhance text summarization by improving the quality, informativeness, and conciseness of summaries. This is achieved through the incorporation of human preferences and values into the training process, which helps mitigate the generation of harmful, biased, or unsafe outputs, promoting more responsible and ethical language generation. The iterative nature of RLHF allows for continuous refinement of both the reward model and the LLM, leading to progressively better alignment with human preferences over time.",
