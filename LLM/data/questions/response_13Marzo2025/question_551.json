  "question": "What is the purpose of setting `temperature` in the `HuggingFaceEndpoint` initialization?",
  "response": "When using the `HuggingFaceEndpoint` class, the `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the Large Language Model's (LLM) output.  A lower temperature, such as 0.1, results in more deterministic and predictable text generation, while higher temperatures introduce more randomness and creativity.",
