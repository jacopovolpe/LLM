  "question": "According to the provided table, how does the embedding dimensionality change as we move from T5-Small to T5-XXL?",
  "response": "The T5 model family includes versions with varying embedding dimensionalities. T5-Small has an embedding dimensionality of 512, while T5-XXL has an embedding dimensionality of 4096. This shows a trend of increasing embedding dimensionality as the model size increases, which generally improves the model's capacity and performance but also requires more computational resources.",
