  "question": "What is the primary focus of Meta's development of the LLaMA language models?",
  "response": "Meta's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) family of transformer-based language models emphasizes efficiency and performance across various NLP tasks. The models are offered in different sizes to suit varying computational resources and performance needs. LLaMA uses Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, similar to GPT, and employs relative positional encodings. It follows a pre-training approach similar to GPT, using autoregressive language modeling, and is trained on \"The Pile,\" a massive dataset of diverse public text sources.",
