  "question": "What is the primary tokenization method used by GPT models?",
  "response": "GPT models utilize Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, which is a subword tokenization technique. BPE balances word-level and character-level representations by breaking down words into smaller, meaningful sub-units (tokens) based on their frequency in the training data. This approach allows for a more efficient representation of both common and infrequent words and handles out-of-vocabulary words gracefully by decomposing them into known subwords. For example, GPT-2 utilizes a vocabulary of around 50,000 tokens.",
