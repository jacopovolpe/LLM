  "question": "What role does the softmax function play in generating the output word?",
  "response": "In the context of the decoder, the final layer consists of a linear layer followed by a softmax function. This projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, creating a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence. The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.",
