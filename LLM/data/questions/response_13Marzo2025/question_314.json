  "question": "What kind of dataset is typically used for fine-tuning a GPT model?",
  "response": "Fine-tuning GPT models involves training them on smaller, labeled datasets curated for the specific target application. This adapts the pre-trained knowledge to the nuances of the downstream task, leading to improved performance. The document also mentions that fine-tuning enables LLMs to achieve good performance even with smaller, focused datasets, which are often easier to curate than massive general-purpose datasets.",
