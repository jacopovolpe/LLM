  "question": "What is the purpose of the `pipeline()` function in Hugging Face?",
  "response": "The lesson notes introduce the Hugging Face ecosystem, a central hub for Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources. The platform revolves around the Hugging Face Hub, which can be found at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/). The Hub provides access to pre-trained models, datasets, and a platform for showcasing interactive demos and sharing code called Spaces. The Hub also provides educational resources which can be found at [https://github.com/huggingface/education-toolkit](https://github.com/huggingface/education-toolkit).\n\nThe Hugging Face ecosystem is powered by open-source libraries, including `datasets`, `transformers`, and `evaluate`. The `datasets` library simplifies downloading and managing datasets from the Hub and supports streaming for handling large datasets efficiently. The `transformers` library provides the building blocks for working with transformer models, including pipelines, tokenizers, and model architectures, and supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow. The `evaluate` library facilitates the computation of various evaluation metrics for assessing model performance.\n\nThe Model Hub, found at [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models), hosts a wide variety of pre-trained models readily available for various NLP tasks. The Datasets Hub, found at [https://hf.co/datasets](https://hf.co/datasets), hosts approximately 3000 open-source and free-to-use datasets.",
