  "question": "What is the first step in the Transformer's pipeline?",
  "response": "The initial step in the Transformer model architecture is tokenization. During tokenization, the input text is transformed into a sequence of discrete units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or characters. Each token is then mapped to a unique numerical identifier, allowing the model to represent and process textual data in a structured manner.",
