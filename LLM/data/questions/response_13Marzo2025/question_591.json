  "question": "What are some common methods for adding guardrails to Large Language Models (LLMs)?",
  "response": "Guardrails are essential mechanisms and policies that govern the behavior of LLMs, acting as a safety net to ensure responses are safe, accurate, relevant, and aligned with ethical and operational guidelines. Several techniques can be used to implement these guardrails, including rule-based filters, fine-tuning with custom data, prompt engineering, external validation layers, and real-time monitoring and feedback. Rule-based filters block or modify outputs based on predefined rules, while fine-tuning with custom data involves training the model on curated datasets. Prompt engineering guides the LLM's behavior through carefully crafted prompts, and external validation layers use external systems or APIs to post-process the output. Real-time monitoring continuously checks outputs for unsafe or incorrect content. It's often best to combine multiple techniques for more robust safeguards.",
