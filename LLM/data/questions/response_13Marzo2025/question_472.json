  "question": "What is the purpose of providing context in a prompt?",
  "response": "Prompts can be designed to achieve various NLP tasks, including text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, code generation, and reasoning. System prompts are instructions provided to the AI model before any user interactions, establishing the initial context and desired behavior for the LLM, shaping its subsequent responses. System prompts can establish the assistant's behavior, context, tone, and any special instructions, guiding the model on how to respond and what it should focus on. Crafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction, and it's best to start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results. Using clear, specific instructions at the beginning of prompts is also important, as is being detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes. A well-structured prompt typically comprises an instruction, context, input data, and an output indicator. In-context learning is a powerful capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting and leveraging information provided directly within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters.\n\nPrompt engineering is a relatively new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications and research areas. By carefully structuring prompts, we can guide LLMs toward more accurate and relevant responses. Providing context is important or beneficial when creating prompts for large language models because it helps steer the model to better responses.",
