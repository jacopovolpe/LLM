  "question": "What techniques are employed by DistilBERT and TinyBERT to reduce model size and increase inference speed?",
  "response": "DistilBERT and TinyBERT are BERT variants designed for smaller model size and faster inference. DistilBERT achieves this through knowledge distillation, while TinyBERT is even smaller and faster, optimized for resource-constrained environments. These models utilize model compression techniques to improve inference speed.",
