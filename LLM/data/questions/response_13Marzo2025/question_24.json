  "response": "The teachers for the course are Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco. Nicola Capuano can be reached at ncapuano@unisa.it or +39 089 964292, and Antonio Greco can be reached at agreco@unisa.it or +39 089 963003. Course materials, assignments, and announcements are available on the university's e-learning platform at https://elearning.unisa.it/. The final evaluation includes a project work involving the design and implementation of an NLP system based on LLMs, and an oral exam covering the course content and a discussion of the project work.\n\nLangChain is a framework for developing LLM-powered applications, offering modular components for integration, connectivity to resources like OpenAI and HuggingFace, and chainable components for complex logic. It supports use cases like chatbots and RAG. Key components include Prompt Templates for structuring prompts, LLMs for model integration, Chat Models for conversational interfaces, Example Selectors for improving LLM performance, Output Parsers for structuring output, Document Loaders for ingesting data, Vector Stores for semantic search, Retrievers for data retrieval, and Agents for enabling LLM decision-making.\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub, accessible at https://huggingface.co/, is a central platform that provides access to pre-trained models, datasets, and Spaces for sharing demos. Key open-source libraries include `datasets` for managing datasets, `transformers` for working with transformer models, and `evaluate` for computing evaluation metrics. The Model Hub can be found at https://huggingface.co/models, and the Datasets Hub can be found at https://hf.co/datasets.",
