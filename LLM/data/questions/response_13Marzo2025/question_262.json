  "question": "What is transfer learning in the context of BERT, and how does it contribute to its effectiveness?",
  "response": "BERT's strengths include effective transfer learning to various downstream tasks, which reduces the need for extensive task-specific data because it is pre-trained on large datasets. However, while transfer learning reduces data requirements, fine-tuning still needs labeled data, which can be expensive to acquire.",
