  "question": "What resource is provided for visualizing the Transformer architecture?",
  "response": "The Transformer model is made up of several key components. The input is the raw textual data that is fed into the model. This raw text is then broken down into tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters, through a process called tokenization. Each token is assigned a unique numerical identifier. These tokens are then represented as dense vectors in a continuous Euclidean space through input embedding, capturing semantic relationships between words. Since the attention mechanism is order-agnostic, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence, enabling the model to understand word order. The encoder processes the input sequence to generate an intermediate representation. The decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation, using masked self-attention to prevent \"peeking\" at future tokens during training. Finally, the output is the generated sequence of tokens, which can then be converted back to text.\n\nThe encoder transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation using stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer. Positional encoding is incorporated because self-attention mechanisms don't inherently account for word order. The encoder processes all input tokens in parallel.\n\nThe multi-head attention mechanism employs multiple \"heads,\" each with its own set of learned weight matrices, allowing the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously. Each head performs a scaled dot-product attention operation, and the results are concatenated and transformed through a linear layer. Multi-Head Attention incorporates Add & Norm (skip connections and layer normalization) and Feed Forward layers.",
