  "question": "How does the lesson connect the concepts of Encoder-Decoder Transformers, the T5 model, and sequence-to-sequence tasks, and what practical applications are emphasized?",
  "response": "Encoder-Decoder Transformers are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where both the input and output are sequences of tokens. The encoder processes the input sequence into hidden representations, while the decoder generates the output sequence, attending to relevant parts of the encoded input. A prominent model using this architecture is the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), developed by Google Research, which frames all tasks as text-to-text problems. T5 is available in various sizes, including T5-Small, T5-Base, T5-Large, T5-XL, and T5-XXL, each with different numbers of encoder and decoder blocks, attention heads, and embedding dimensionality. T5 utilizes a SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000 tokens and incorporates special tokens like `<pad>`, `<unk>`, `<eos>`, and task-specific prefixes. T5's pre-training employs a denoising autoencoder objective called span corruption, masking random spans of text and training the model to reconstruct the original text, leveraging the C4 dataset. Decoder-only transformers can be applied to a wide range of tasks including text generation, conversational AI, programming help, summarization, and translation. Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained T5 model for specific downstream tasks, maintaining the text-to-text paradigm with task-specific prefixes. Several T5 variants have been developed for specific purposes and improvements, including mT5, Flan-T5, ByT5, T5-3B/11B, UL2, Multimodal T5, and Efficient T5. For practical examples and code for implementing translation and summarization using T5, resources are available at the provided Hugging Face guides.",
