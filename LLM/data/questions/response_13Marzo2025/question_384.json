  "question": "Explain the role of Adafactor and learning rate scheduling (including warm-up and decay) in T5's training process.",
  "response": "Adafactor optimization and learning rate scheduling are important aspects of T5's pre-training. Specifically, T5 uses Adafactor, a memory-efficient optimizer designed for large-scale training, to update the model's parameters. The learning rate is adjusted throughout training using a warm-up phase followed by inverse square root decay; this strategy helps the model converge efficiently and avoid getting stuck in local minima.",
