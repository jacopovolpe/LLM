  "question": "What are the primary components of the encoder and decoder in a Transformer?",
  "response": "The Transformer model consists of several key components. The input is raw textual data that undergoes tokenization, which breaks it down into individual units or tokens, each assigned a unique numerical identifier. These tokens are then represented as dense vectors in a continuous Euclidean space through input embedding, capturing semantic relationships. Positional encoding adds information about the position of each token in the sequence, accounting for word order. The encoder processes the input sequence to generate an intermediate representation, using multiple identical layers with self-attention and a feed-forward network. The decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation, also using masked self-attention. Finally, the output is the generated sequence of tokens, convertible back to text.\n\nThe encoder transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation using stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer, processing all input tokens in parallel. The decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, considering the encoder's output and previously generated words, using a second multi-head attention mechanism called encoder-decoder attention. The decoder block structure mirrors the encoder block. Masked self-attention prevents the decoder from attending to future positions during training. The final layer is a linear layer followed by a softmax function, projecting the output to the vocabulary size.\n\nEncoder-Decoder Transformers are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, using the attention mechanism to capture dependencies between input and output sequences. The encoder processes the input sequence into hidden representations, and the decoder generates the output sequence, attending to relevant parts of the encoded input.",
