  "question": "What is the primary benefit of using TF-IDF compared to just using Term Frequency (TF)?",
  "response": "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) improves upon Term Frequency (TF) by considering a term's prevalence across the entire corpus. It reduces the weight of common words and increases the weight of rare words that are more likely to be informative. TF-IDF is calculated as the product of TF and IDF, where a high TF-IDF score indicates a term that is frequent within a document but rare across the corpus, suggesting high relevance to that document.\n\nTF quantifies the importance of a word within a document based on its frequency of occurrence, assuming that words appearing more frequently are more central to the document's topic. However, relying solely on raw word counts can be misleading because a word appearing many times in a long document might not be as significant as the same word appearing fewer times in a short document.",
