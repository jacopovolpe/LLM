  "response": "The text-to-text paradigm in T5 streamlines the fine-tuning process by treating all inputs and outputs as text strings, simplifying the adaptation process. Task-specific prefixes guide the model, for example, `summarize: <document>` for summarization, `translate English to French: <text>` for translation, and `question: <question> context: <context>` for question answering.",
