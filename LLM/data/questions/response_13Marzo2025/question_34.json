  "question": "What role does backpropagation through time (BPTT) play in the vanishing gradient problem observed in RNNs?",
  "response": "Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), used to train RNNs, contributes to the vanishing gradient problem because, as gradients are propagated back through the network, they can diminish exponentially. This makes it difficult to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The repeated multiplication of small derivative values during BPTT leads to the vanishing gradient, effectively preventing the network from adjusting its weights based on earlier parts of the sequence.",
