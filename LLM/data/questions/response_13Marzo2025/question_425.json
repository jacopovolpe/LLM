  "question": "How does Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) contribute to the development of interactive AI applications?",
  "response": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances interactive AI applications by directly incorporating human judgment into the training process. This approach bridges the gap between objective model performance metrics and subjective human evaluations, aligning model outputs with human values, preferences, and communication norms. The benefits of RLHF include improved alignment with user instructions and expectations, reduced generation of unsafe or harmful content, and more natural and engaging interactions. The iterative nature of RLHF allows for continuous improvement by incorporating new human feedback as the model evolves, leading to progressively better alignment with human preferences and more user-centric behavior.",
