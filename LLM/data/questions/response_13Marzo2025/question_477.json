  "question": "How does providing reference material in a prompt contribute to in-context learning?",
  "response": "Instruction fine-tuning enhances LLMs by training them on datasets of (instruction, input, output) triples, improving their ability to understand instructions and generate accurate responses. The training dataset includes a human-readable instruction specifying the task, optional context providing relevant background information, and the desired output.\n\nPrompt engineering is a new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications. It enhances understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, improves performance on tasks, facilitates integration with other tools, and enables new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge. A well-structured prompt includes an instruction specifying the task, context providing relevant background information, input data, and an output indicator specifying the desired output format.\n\nSystem prompts are instructions provided to the AI model before any user interactions to establish the initial context and desired behavior, shaping its subsequent responses. They can establish the assistant's behavior, context, tone, and any special instructions, guiding the model on how to respond and what it should focus on. Examples of system prompts include, \"You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant who answers questions accurately and concisely,\" or \"You are an IT support assistant specializing in troubleshooting software and hardware issues. Respond politely and guide users through step-by-step solutions.\"\n\nIn-context learning is a capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting information provided within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters. A prompt context for in-context learning may specify reference material, input-output pairs, step-by-step instructions, clarifications, and templates.\n\nCrafting effective prompts involves starting with simple prompts and iterating, using clear and specific instructions, being detailed and descriptive, using examples to guide the modelâ€™s output, and balancing detail and length carefully. Examples of good prompts include, \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings,\" or \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\"\n\nThe Transformer architecture offers advantages such as self-attention, scalability, stackability, byte pair encoding, and positional encodings. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, while scalability allows Transformers to be scaled to much larger datasets and model sizes.",
