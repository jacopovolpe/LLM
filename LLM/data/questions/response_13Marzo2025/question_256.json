  "question": "What is the role of the `[CLS]` token's representation in fine-tuning BERT for a specific task?",
  "response": "When fine-tuning BERT for downstream tasks, the `[CLS]` token's representation is crucial. It is specifically trained to capture the nuances required for the target task. After processing the input, BERT's final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context of the sequence. This embedding is then used for downstream tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.",
