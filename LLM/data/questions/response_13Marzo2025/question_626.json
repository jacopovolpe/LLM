  "question": "What are the different variations of the Bag of Words (BoW) model and how do they differ in their representation of text?",
  "response": "The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model represents text as a vector of word counts, while disregarding word order and grammar. There are several variations of the BoW model. One-hot encoding represents each word in the vocabulary as a vector with a single '1' at the index corresponding to the word and '0' elsewhere. Binary BoW combines one-hot vectors using the OR operation, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each word in the vocabulary. Standard BoW sums the one-hot vectors, representing the count of each word. Term Frequency (TF) focuses on the raw counts of each word. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) improves upon TF by considering a term's prevalence across the entire corpus, reducing the weight of common words and increasing the weight of rare words.",
