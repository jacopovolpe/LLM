  "question": "Explain the purpose of the `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens in BERT's input encoding.",
  "response": "BERT uses special tokens, namely `[CLS]` and `[SEP]`, during input encoding. The `[CLS]` token is added at the beginning of each sequence and serves as an aggregate representation of the entire sequence. The final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context, which is then used for downstream tasks like classification. The `[SEP]` token is used to separate sentences within a sequence or to mark the end of a single sentence.",
