  "question": "How does TRL integrate with the Hugging Face Transformers library?",
  "response": "The Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library is specifically designed for training Transformer language models using reinforcement learning and provides a full suite of tools for implementing the key stages of RLHF, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward model training (RM), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). TRL seamlessly integrates with the Hugging Face Transformers library, simplifying the process of applying RLHF to existing Transformer models.",
