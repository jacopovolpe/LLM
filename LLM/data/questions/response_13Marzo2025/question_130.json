  "question": "How is the final output word selected for each time step?",
  "response": "The final layer of the decoder in a language model is a linear layer, often sharing weights with the input embedding matrix, followed by a softmax function. This projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, producing a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence. The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.",
