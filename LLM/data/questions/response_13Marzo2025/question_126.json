  "question": "What is the purpose of the linear layer in the decoder output process?",
  "response": "In sequence-to-sequence models, the final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function. This projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, producing a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence. The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.",
