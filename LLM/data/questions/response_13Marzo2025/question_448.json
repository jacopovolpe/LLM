  "question": "Why is the diversity of the training data important in instruction fine-tuning?",
  "response": "Instruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and respond to user instructions by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples. The diversity of the training data is crucial for robust generalization, enabling the LLM to interpret user intent and generate appropriate outputs, improving its usability in real-world applications.",
