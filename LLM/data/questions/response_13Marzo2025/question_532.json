  "question": "Focusing on Chapter 2 (excluding section 2.3) of \"Natural Language Processing in Action,\" what core NLP concepts are likely discussed in Lesson 20 on Retrieval Augmented Generation?",
  "response": "I am sorry, but I cannot provide information from Chapter 2 of \"Natural Language Processing in Action\" (excluding section 2.3) specifically tailored to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Lesson 20, as the provided context does not contain that level of detail. However, the textbook \"Natural Language Processing in Action: Understanding, analyzing, and generating text with Python\" is a recommended text for the course and covers NLP concepts. Additionally, the lesson material explores RAG concepts, including indexing (loading, splitting/chunking, and vectorization) and retrieval and generation at runtime.",
