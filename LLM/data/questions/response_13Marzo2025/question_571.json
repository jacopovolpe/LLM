  "question": "How can RLHF be used to improve the engagement and helpfulness of dialogue systems?",
  "response": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can enhance the naturalness, engagement, and helpfulness of conversational agents, which are types of dialogue systems. RLHF is a technique for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) by using human feedback to guide the learning process, aligning model outputs with human values, preferences, and communication norms. The RLHF workflow involves three stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward model training, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning. The iterative improvement offered by RLHF, incorporating new human feedback as the model evolves, is a key advantage.",
