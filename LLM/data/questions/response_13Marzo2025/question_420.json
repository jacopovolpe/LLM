  "question": "What are some specific examples of when you might choose to use Instruction Fine-Tuning over other methods?",
  "response": "Instruction fine-tuning is preferred when you want to enhance an LLM's ability to understand and respond to user instructions. This is achieved by training the LLM on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples, which improves its ability to generalize to new instructions and generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Instruction fine-tuning is useful in real-world applications because it allows the LLM to interpret user intent and generate appropriate outputs.",
