  "question": "Explain the concept of prompt engineering and provide an example of how it can be used to constrain an LLM's responses.",
  "response": "Prompt engineering is a discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications. It enhances the understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, improves LLM performance on tasks like question answering and reasoning, helps in interfacing with LLMs and integrating them with other tools, and enables new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge.\n\nWhen writing good prompts, it's helpful to start simple and add elements gradually, using clear and specific instructions at the beginning. Being detailed and descriptive can lead to better outcomes, and using examples can guide the model's output. It's also important to balance detail and length carefully.\n\nHere are some examples that illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n*   **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"\n*   **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\"\n\n*   **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"\n*   **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\"\n\n*   **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\"\n*   **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\"\n\n*   **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\"\n*   **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\"\n\n*   **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"\n*   **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\"\n\n*   **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\"\n*   **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"\n\nPrompts can also be designed to achieve various NLP tasks, showcasing the versatility of LLMs, including text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, code generation, and reasoning.",
