  "question": "What are the recommended environments for practicing the provided exercises, and how can they be set up?",
  "response": "For setting up your development environment to practice the exercises, several options are available. The simplest approach is using Google Colab, a cloud-based environment. To use it, install the `transformers` library with `!pip install transformers`. For the full version including all dependencies, use `!pip install transformers[sentencepiece]`, noting that the `sentencepiece` library is often needed for subword tokenization.\n\nAlternatively, for local development, using a virtual environment is recommended. Anaconda simplifies package management; you can download and install it from [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download). To create a new environment, use the command `conda create --name nlpllm`. Activate it with `conda activate nlpllm`, and then install the `transformers` library with the necessary dependencies using `conda install transformers[sentencepiece]`.\n\nFor building interactive demos, Gradio can be installed using `conda install gradio`, and more information is available at [https://bit.ly/34wESgd](https://bit.ly/34wESgd). Finally, creating a Hugging Face account is recommended for seamless integration with the Hub.",
