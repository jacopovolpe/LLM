  "question": "What is the primary function of the encoder in this context?",
  "response": "The encoder's main purpose is to transform the input sequence into a contextualized representation. It consists of stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer, and processes all input tokens in parallel. Because self-attention mechanisms don't inherently account for word order, the encoder incorporates positional encoding, typically achieved by adding sinusoidal functions to the input embeddings, providing information about the position of each word in the sequence. The encoder's design, where each block maintains the same output dimensionality as the input, allows for stacking multiple encoder blocks, where the output of one block becomes the input to the next, enabling the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input sequence.",
