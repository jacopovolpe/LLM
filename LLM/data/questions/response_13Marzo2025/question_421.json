  "question": "What are the primary benefits of fine-tuning a large language model (LLM)?",
  "response": "Fine-tuning tailors a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on a dataset relevant to the target application, allowing the model to specialize its knowledge and improve its performance on the downstream task. The main advantages of fine-tuning are domain specialization, enhanced accuracy and relevance, and effective utilization of smaller datasets. Domain specialization allows LLMs to acquire expertise in specific areas, such as medical, legal, or financial. Fine-tuning improves the accuracy and relevance of LLM outputs for specific applications. It also enables LLMs to achieve good performance even with smaller, focused datasets.",
