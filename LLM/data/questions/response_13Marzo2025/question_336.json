  "question": "What is the primary training objective used in pre-training LLaMA?",
  "response": "During the pre-training phase, LLaMA, like GPT, employs autoregressive language modeling as its training objective, meaning it predicts the next token in a sequence. The training process involves minimizing cross-entropy loss, typically using optimizers like SGD or Adam with gradient clipping and other optimization techniques such as mixed precision training, learning rate schedules, and weight decay.",
