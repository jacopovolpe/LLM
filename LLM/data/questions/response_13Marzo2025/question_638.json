  "question": "What does a high TF-IDF score signify about a term's relevance to a document?",
  "response": "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) enhances Term Frequency (TF) by factoring in a term's prevalence across the entire corpus. It diminishes the weight of common words and amplifies the weight of rare words, which are more likely to be informative. A high TF-IDF score signifies a term that appears frequently within a document but is rare across the corpus, indicating its high relevance to that specific document.",
