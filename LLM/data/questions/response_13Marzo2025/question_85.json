It is also used in the legal field for automating document review, conducting legal research, and analyzing contracts. Furthermore, NLP powers customer service by automating responses, guiding users, and analyzing feedback. In education, it automates grading, develops learning tools, and summarizes text. The automotive industry utilizes NLP for intelligent navigation and voice-controlled systems, while the technology sector uses it for code generation, completion, and review. In media and entertainment, NLP generates scripts, writes articles, and crafts interactive narratives.\n\nGiven the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies (2023) positioning NLP-related technologies near the \"Peak of Inflated Expectations\" and the projected market growth to $18.9 billion by 2023, along with a 22% employment growth between 2020 and 2030, several skills and knowledge areas would be beneficial for career advancement. Knowledge in basic concepts of NLP, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Natural Language Generation (NLG), statistical approaches to NLP, Large Language Models (LLM) based on Transformers, NLP applications with LLM, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning of LLMs is crucial. Ability to design and implement an NLP system based on LLMs, integrating existing technologies and tools, is also essential.",
