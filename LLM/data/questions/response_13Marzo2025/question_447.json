  "question": "How does instruction fine-tuning improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs)?",
  "response": "Instruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and respond to user instructions. This is achieved by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples. The training dataset includes a human-readable prompt specifying the desired task, which is the instruction. It can also include relevant background information or data as context, and the desired response to the given instruction and context as the output. By training on a diverse range of instruction-response pairs, the LLM learns to interpret user intent and generate appropriate outputs, improving its usability in real-world applications. The diversity of the training data is crucial for robust generalization.",
