  "question": "What are the final two layers of the decoder and how do they contribute to generating the probability distribution for the next word in the sequence?",
  "response": "The final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function. The linear layer projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, and then the softmax function produces a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence. The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.",
