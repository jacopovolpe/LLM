  "response": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which is a crucial technique for refining Large Language Models (LLMs). It explores the core concepts, workflow, benefits, drawbacks, and applications of RLHF, along with practical implementation guidance using the Transformers TRL library. The document also contextualizes RLHF within the broader landscape of LLM development and fine-tuning.\n\nThe elements of a well-structured prompt typically comprise the following: Instruction, which is a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform; Context, which is external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses; Input Data, which is the input or question that we are interested in finding a response for; and Output Indicator, which is the type or format of the output.\n\nIn-context learning is a powerful capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting and leveraging information provided directly within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters. A prompt context for in-context learning may specify Reference Material, Input-Output Pairs, Step-by-Step Instructions, Clarifications, and Templates. Prompt engineering heavily leverages in-context learning to efficiently guide LLMs towards desired behaviors without requiring retraining.\n\nThe Decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, using the contextualized representation generated by the encoder. At each step, the decoder considers the encoder's output and the previously generated words in the output sequence. The decoder block structure mirrors the encoder block, with the addition of a second multi-head attention mechanism, called encoder-decoder attention. The original Transformer architecture used 6 decoder blocks. A key difference from the encoder's self-attention is the \"masked\" self-attention within the decoder. The final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function.\n\nMasked Multi-Head Attention is crucial for training the decoder. During the generation of the *i*-th output word, the decoder should only consider the preceding words (positions 1 to *i-1*) and not \"peek\" into the future. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention scores, effectively setting the scores corresponding to future positions to negative infinity.\n\nEncoder-Decoder Attention bridges the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to leverage the contextualized information encoded by the encoder. In this mechanism, the queries come from the decoder, while the keys and values are derived from the encoder's output.\n\nThe final decoder output for each time step is a vector representing the generated word. This vector is fed through a linear layer, which is often tied (shared weights) with the input embedding matrix, and a softmax function to compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary. The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.\n\nThe Transformer processes sequential data through a distinct pipeline. First, the encoder processes the entire input sequence, generating a set of contextualized representations. Next, the decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time. At each step, the decoder receives the encoder's output and the previously generated words. This process repeats until an end-of-sequence token is generated, signaling the completion of the output sequence.\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a chatbot capable of accurately and comprehensively answering questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM 2024/2025 course. Deliverables for this project include the complete chatbot code and a detailed report explaining the design choices, implemented methodologies, and justification for the chosen tools and technologies.\n\nStudents are granted the freedom to utilize any tools and technologies discussed during the course, encompassing both modern Large Language Model (LLM) based approaches and traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.\n\nThe evaluation process will consist of two phases, both conducted by the course instructors before the project discussion. In the first phase, the chatbot will be assessed in real-time using a pre-determined set of questions related to the course content. The evaluation criteria for this phase are Relevance, Fluency, and Coherence. In the second phase, a different set of pre-defined questions will be used to evaluate Robustness and Precision. The final project grade will be based on the chatbot's performance across all these evaluation criteria.\n\nGPT, developed by OpenAI, represents a prominent family of decoder-only transformers. The different versions include GPT-1 (2018), GPT-2 (2019), GPT-3 (2020), and GPT-4 (2023).\n\nGPT models employ Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization. The key advantages of BPE are that it handles morphology and new words effectively, has a reduced vocabulary size, and has robust out-of-vocabulary handling.\n\nGPT models are pre-trained using a next-token prediction objective, also known as autoregressive language modeling.",
