  "question": "Despite its state-of-the-art performance, what computational challenges does using BERT present?",
  "response": "Despite its strengths, BERT has limitations, including requiring substantial computational resources for pre-training and fine-tuning, especially for larger models. The large model size can also pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. While transfer learning reduces data requirements, fine-tuning still needs labeled data, which can be expensive to acquire.",
