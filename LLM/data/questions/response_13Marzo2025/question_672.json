  "question": "How does the model training process work in ML-based text classification, and what are some examples of algorithms used?",
  "response": "In machine learning-based text classification, a model learns from a training set of annotated documents, where each document is associated with its correct class labels. The process generally involves: converting text into a numerical vector format that ML algorithms can process, such as TF-IDF, which weighs words based on their importance within a document and across the corpus; using a labeled dataset to train an ML algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks) to learn the relationship between text features and class labels; and applying the trained model to classify new, unseen documents by predicting their likely categories, often providing a confidence score. An example of text classification is the Reuters 21578 dataset, which contains news articles classified into 90 distinct categories, highlighting the complexities of real-world text data, including its multi-class, multi-label, imbalanced classes, and variable document length characteristics.",
