  "question": "What is the expected output format when fine-tuning T5 for a question-answering task using the provided example prefix?",
  "response": "Fine-tuning T5 adapts the pre-trained model for specific downstream tasks while maintaining the text-to-text paradigm, where all inputs and outputs are treated as text strings. Task-specific prefixes guide the model. For question answering, the prefix and format would be: `question: <question> context: <context>` â†’ `<answer>`.",
