  "question": "What is Instruction Fine-Tuning and how does it differ from other fine-tuning approaches?",
  "response": "Instruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and respond to user instructions by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples. This improves the model's ability to generalize to new instructions and generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. In contrast, traditional fine-tuning tailors a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on a dataset relevant to the target application, allowing the model to specialize its knowledge and improve its performance on the downstream task. Instruction fine-tuning focuses on aligning the LLM with specific instructions or prompts, making it more responsive and adaptable to diverse user queries.",
