  "question": "How does the decoder utilize the encoder's output and previously generated words to produce the output sequence?",
  "response": "The decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, using the contextualized representation generated by the encoder. At each step, the decoder considers the encoder's output and the previously generated words in the output sequence. The decoder block structure mirrors the encoder block, with the addition of a second multi-head attention mechanism, called encoder-decoder attention, which allows the decoder to attend to the relevant parts of the encoder's output when generating each word in the output sequence. The final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function, projecting the decoder's output to the vocabulary size and producing a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence. The final decoder output for each time step is a vector representing the generated word. This vector is fed through a linear layer and a softmax function to compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary, and the word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.",
