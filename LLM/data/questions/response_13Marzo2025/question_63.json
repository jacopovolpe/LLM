  "question": "What are the three matrices used in the self-attention mechanism, and how are they derived?",
  "response": "The self-attention mechanism employs three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). These matrices are derived from the input embeddings through linear transformations. The attention weights are calculated using scaled dot-product attention, which measures the similarity between query and key vectors. These weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the input sequence. The scaling factor (1/âˆšdk) is crucial for preventing extremely small gradients during training, especially with high-dimensional vectors.",
