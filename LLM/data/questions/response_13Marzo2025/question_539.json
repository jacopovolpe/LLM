  "question": "Can you describe the general process of constructing a RAG system using LangChain and HuggingFace?",
  "response": "LangChain is a framework designed to streamline the development of LLM-powered applications, and it can be used to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. LangChain provides modular components for integrating LLMs into various workflows, connects to diverse resources, and its components can be chained together to create complex application logic. Some key components include prompt templates for structuring prompts, integrations with various LLMs, specialized handling of chat models, example selectors, output parsers, document loaders, vector stores, retrievers, and agents.\n\nTo install LangChain and related libraries, you can use the following commands: `pip install langchain`, `pip install langchain_community`, `pip install langchain_huggingface`, `pip install pypdf`, and `pip install faiss-cpu`.\n\nRAG addresses the limitations of LLMs by enriching them with access to external and private data sources. RAG applications involve indexing and retrieval/generation stages. Indexing involves loading data from various sources, splitting documents into smaller chunks, and storing these chunks in a Vector Store as vector embeddings. During retrieval and generation, the system retrieves relevant data chunks from the Vector Store based on the user's query, incorporates this data into a prompt, and feeds the augmented prompt to the LLM to generate a response.\n\nTo query a LLM model from Hugging Face, you can use the following code, making sure to store your API key securely as an environment variable:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint\nimport os\n\n# Store API key securely as an environment variable.\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"] = \"YOUR_API_TOKEN\"\n\nllm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(\n    repo_id=\"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\",\n    temperature=0.1  # Controls randomness of LLM output\n)\n\nquery = \"Who won the FIFA World Cup in the year 2006?\"\nprint(llm.invoke(query))\n```\n\nPrompt templates provide a structured way to interact with LLMs:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntemplate = \"Who won the {competition} in the year {year}?\"\nprompt_template = PromptTemplate(\n    template=template,\n    input_variables=[\"competition\", \"year\"]\n)\n\nquery = prompt_template.invoke({\"competition\": \"Davis Cup\", \"year\": \"2018\"})\nanswer = llm.invoke(query)\n\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nChains enable sequential execution of multiple steps:\n\n```python\nchain = prompt_template | llm  # Pipe operator connects template and LLM\nanswer = chain.invoke({\"competition\": \"Davis Cup\", \"year\": \"2018\"})\n\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nHugging Face offers a Model Hub where you can find a wide variety of pre-trained models.",
