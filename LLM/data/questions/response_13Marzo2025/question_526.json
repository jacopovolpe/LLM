  "response": "spaCy is a powerful open-source Python library designed for advanced NLP tasks. It offers pre-trained language models that include functionalities like tokenization, part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Furthermore, spaCy provides detailed token attributes such as `is_stop`, `pos_`, and `lemma_`, simplifies common NLP tasks, and features a built-in visualizer called displaCy for analyzing syntactic dependencies and named entities. spaCy's NER is capable of identifying and classifying real-world objects, such as persons, organizations, and locations, using specific labels.",
