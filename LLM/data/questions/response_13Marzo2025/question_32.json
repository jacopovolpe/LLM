  "question": "How does the sequential nature of RNNs impact their training speed, particularly when dealing with long sequences?",
  "response": "RNNs process data sequentially, meaning they handle one input at a time. This sequentiality prevents the network from leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, resulting in significantly slower training times, especially for long sequences. The network must complete processing 𝑥𝑖−1 before starting on 𝑥𝑖, creating a bottleneck.",
