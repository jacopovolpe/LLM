  "question": "What is the core architectural component that BERT utilizes from the Transformer model?",
  "response": "BERT leverages the encoder part of the transformer architecture. The encoder transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation and consists of stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer. The encoder processes all input tokens in parallel. BERT's key strength lies in its ability to understand bidirectional context using bidirectional self-attention, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words to understand the meaning of a word within a sentence.",
