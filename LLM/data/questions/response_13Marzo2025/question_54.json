  "question": "What is the purpose of using periodic functions in creating positional encodings?",
  "response": "Positional encodings use periodic functions, specifically sine and cosine, to create unique representations for each position. This ensures that the model differentiates between sequences with the same words in different orders by adding position-specific information to the input embeddings.",
