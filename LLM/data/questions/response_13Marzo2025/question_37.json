  "question": "How does the Transformer architecture achieve parallel processing of sequence elements, and what benefits does this offer?",
  "response": "The Transformer model architecture enables parallel computation across sequence elements through its self-attention mechanism. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process sequences sequentially, self-attention allows the model to consider relationships between all words in a sequence simultaneously. The advantages of this parallel processing include reduced training time and the ability to handle long-range dependencies more effectively.",
