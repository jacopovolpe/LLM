  "question": "Beyond words, what other elements can be considered tokens in NLP, and why are they significant?",
  "response": "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), a token is the smallest meaningful unit of text that an NLP system considers. Besides words, tokens can also include punctuation marks, emojis, numbers, sub-words, and phrases. Punctuation marks are important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure. Emojis convey emotional information. Numbers can represent quantities or other numerical data. Sub-words can help with handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological information. Phrases represent multi-word expressions that function as a single unit.",
