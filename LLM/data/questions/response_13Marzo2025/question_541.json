  "question": "What are the three main limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) that Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses?",
  "response": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have broad reasoning capabilities but also face limitations. These include a knowledge cutoff, meaning their knowledge is limited to the data they were trained on, making them unaware of new information or events after that cutoff date. LLMs also have an inability to access external information, restricting their capacity to respond to queries requiring current data. Moreover, standard LLMs are not designed to process private or proprietary information, posing security risks when handling sensitive data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by enriching LLMs with access to external and private data sources, broadening their knowledge and enabling them to work with sensitive data securely.",
