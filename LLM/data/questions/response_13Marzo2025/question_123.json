  "question": "How does Encoder-Decoder Attention help the decoder generate more contextually relevant output sequences?",
  "response": "Encoder-Decoder Attention bridges the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to leverage the contextualized information encoded by the encoder. In this mechanism, the queries come from the decoder, while the keys and values are derived from the encoder's output. This allows the decoder to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the output sequence. The decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, using the contextualized representation generated by the encoder. At each step, the decoder considers the encoder's output and the previously generated words in the output sequence. The encoder processes the input sequence, transforming it into a set of hidden representations that capture the meaning and context of the input. The decoder then takes these representations and generates the output sequence, one token at a time, while attending to relevant parts of the encoded input. This attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input when generating each output token, leading to improved performance, especially in tasks like machine translation.",
