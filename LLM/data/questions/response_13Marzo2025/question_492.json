  "question": "How does the \"Additional Context\" connect the complexities of using LLMs for reasoning tasks to the importance of prompt engineering techniques?",
  "response": "Prompts can be designed to achieve various NLP tasks, including text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, code generation, and reasoning. System prompts, provided *before* any user interactions, establish the initial context, desired behavior, tone, and any special instructions for the LLM. Instruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and respond to user instructions by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples. Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications and research areas. The goals of prompt engineering are to enhance understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, improve LLM performance on a broad range of tasks, help interfacing with LLMs and integrating with other tools, and enable new capabilities, such as augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external resources. A well-structured prompt typically comprises an instruction, context, input data, and output indicator. In-context learning is a powerful capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting and leveraging information provided directly within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters.",
