  "question": "How does the Hugging Face ecosystem facilitate the use of pre-trained models for token classification and named entity recognition?",
  "response": "The Hugging Face ecosystem offers several resources for working with pre-trained models for token classification and named entity recognition (NER). The Hugging Face Hub ([https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)) provides access to a vast collection of pre-trained models suitable for various NLP tasks, including token classification and NER. You can find these models on the Model Hub ([https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)), where they are categorized and searchable. The `transformers` library provides the building blocks for working with transformer models, including pipelines, tokenizers, and model architectures. The Hugging Face tutorial (https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/2?fw=pt) offers practical guidance on using BERT for token classification and named entity recognition. It recommends exploring different BERT versions, testing with custom prompts and public datasets like CoNLL-2003 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/eriktks/conll2003), and fine-tuning lightweight BERT versions when resources permit.",
