  "question": "How does Prefix Tuning influence the model's attention mechanism?",
  "response": "Prefix Tuning involves adding a sequence of trainable prefix vectors to the input sequence. These prefixes influence the model's attention mechanism, guiding its output generation without modifying the underlying model weights. This approach is parameter-efficient, as only the prefix vectors are trained. The length of the prefix sequence controls the trade-off between task-specific expressiveness and parameter efficiency.",
