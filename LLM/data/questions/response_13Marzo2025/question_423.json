  "question": "What are the main disadvantages of employing a full fine-tuning approach?",
  "response": "Full fine-tuning, while potentially leading to high accuracy, has significant drawbacks. These include high computational costs, as updating all parameters requires substantial resources and training time. Also, with small datasets, full fine-tuning can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.",
