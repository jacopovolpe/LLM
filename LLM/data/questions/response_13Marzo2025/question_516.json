  "question": "What is the core difference between stemming and lemmatization in terms of their approach to word reduction?",
  "response": "Stemming reduces words to their root form (stem) by heuristically removing prefixes and suffixes and can produce non-words. Common stemming algorithms include the Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer. Lemmatization, on the other hand, uses dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine a word's canonical form (lemma), considering its part of speech, and always results in a valid word. Lemmatization is generally more accurate but computationally slower than stemming.",
