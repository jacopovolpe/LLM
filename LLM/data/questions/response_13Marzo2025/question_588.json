  "question": "What are the primary steps involved in detoxifying a Large Language Model using PPO, as demonstrated in the TRL example?",
  "response": "The Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library offers an example of detoxifying a Large Language Model with PPO, which can be found at [https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.7.8/detoxifying_a_lm](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.7.8/detoxifying_a_lm). The TRL library is designed for training Transformer language models using reinforcement learning and provides tools for implementing key stages of RLHF, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).",
