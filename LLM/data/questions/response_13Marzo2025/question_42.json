  "question": "How does input embedding represent textual data and what is its significance?",
  "response": "Input embeddings are a crucial component in natural language processing because they represent words in a format that machine learning models can understand. They project tokens into a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words, where similar words tend to have similar vector representations, allowing the model to learn meaningful associations. Some methods for generating input embeddings include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. Word2Vec, introduced by Google in 2013, is a neural network-based method for generating word embeddings using unsupervised learning on large text corpora. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) uses matrix factorization techniques for faster training and comparable accuracy. FastText leverages subword information, making it effective for rare words, morphologically rich languages, and handling misspellings.",
