  "question": "Given a corrupted input like \"The <extra_id_0> jumped <extra_id_1> the fence.\",  provide a plausible target output assuming the original sentence was about a cat.",
  "response": "Based on the provided context, T5's pre-training uses a denoising autoencoder objective called span corruption. This means that T5 masks random spans of text within the input and trains the model to reconstruct the original text. In the example, the original input is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" and the corrupted input is \"The quick `<extra_id_0>` jumps `<extra_id_1>` dog,\" with the target output being `<extra_id_0>` brown fox `<extra_id_1>` over the lazy. Therefore, given a corrupted sentence \"The <extra_id_0> jumped <extra_id_1> the fence,\" and knowing the subject is a cat, a plausible original sentence is \"The cat quickly jumped over the fence\".",
