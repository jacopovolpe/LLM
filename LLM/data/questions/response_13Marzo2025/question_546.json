  "question": "What are the core building blocks provided by LangChain for LLM application development?",
  "response": "LangChain is a framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides modular components that can be chained together to create complex application logic and connects to various resources, including LLMs like OpenAI and HuggingFace, data sources like Slack and Notion, and external tools. LangChain supports a wide range of use cases, such as chatbots, document search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), question answering, data processing, and information extraction. It offers both open-source and commercially available components.\n\nKey components of LangChain include prompt templates, which are standardized formats for structuring prompts. It also includes integrations with various third-party LLMs and specialized handling of conversational interfaces through chat models. Example selectors intelligently choose relevant examples to include in prompts. Output parsers structure LLM output into specific formats. Document loaders ingest data from diverse sources, and vector stores facilitate efficient semantic search. Retrievers provide a unified interface for retrieving data, and agents empower LLMs to make decisions and take actions.",
