  "question": "In what ways do relative positional encodings enhance the generalization capabilities of LLaMA across diverse contexts?",
  "response": "LLaMA utilizes Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, with a vocabulary size of 32,768 tokens. LLaMA employs relative positional encodings, which offer advantages in handling variable sequence lengths and improving generalization across different contexts. This is in contrast to the absolute positional encodings used in some other transformer models.",
