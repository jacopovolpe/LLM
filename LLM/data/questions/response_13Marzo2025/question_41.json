  "question": "What is the purpose of tokenization in a Transformer model?",
  "response": "Tokenization is a fundamental step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer models. It involves transforming text into a sequence of discrete units called tokens, which are then mapped to unique numerical IDs. These tokens can be words, punctuation marks, emojis, numbers, sub-words or phrases. Tokenization allows the model to represent and process textual data in a structured manner. A good tokenizer should correctly separate elements like numbers and punctuation. For example, in the sentence \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51,\" a good tokenizer should correctly separate \"51\" and \".\".",
