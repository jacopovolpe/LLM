  "question": "How does BPE contribute to the efficient training of language models compared to character-level tokenization?",
  "response": "Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) offers efficiency in language model training compared to character-level tokenization by resulting in a smaller vocabulary, which makes training more efficient. BPE also handles morphology and new words effectively and provides robust out-of-vocabulary handling by decomposing unknown words into subwords or characters.",
