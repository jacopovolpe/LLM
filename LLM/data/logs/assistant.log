It begins by explaining the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which motivated the development of Transformers.  Following this, the core components of the Transformer model are detailed, focusing on the mechanism of self-attention.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Limitations of RNNs**\n\nRNNs, while powerful for sequential data processing, face several inherent limitations that hinder their performance, especially with long sequences:\n\n* **Vanishing Gradients:** This problem arises during backpropagation through time (BPTT), the algorithm used to train RNNs.  As gradients are propagated back through the network, they can diminish exponentially, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The repeated multiplication of small derivative values during BPTT leads to the vanishing gradient, effectively preventing the network from adjusting its weights based on earlier parts of the sequence.\n\n* **Slow Training:** RNNs process data sequentially, meaning they handle one input at a time.  This inherent sequentiality prevents the network from leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, resulting in significantly slower training times, especially for long sequences.  The network must complete processing ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 before starting on ùë•ùëñ, creating a bottleneck.\n\n* **Limited Long-Term Memory:** RNNs struggle to retain information from earlier stages of the sequence when processing long sequences. Information from the beginning of a sequence is gradually lost as the network proceeds, making it difficult for the model to understand and utilize context over extended spans of text. This is typically represented by a context vector, which has a fixed size and thus cannot effectively store information from arbitrarily long sequences.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Transformer**\n\nIntroduced by Google Brain in 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by addressing the shortcomings of RNNs. It enables parallel processing of sequence elements, significantly speeding up training and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. The number of layers traversed is independent of the sequence length, contributing to its efficiency and ability to handle long-range dependencies. While initially designed for machine translation, its components are adaptable to various NLP tasks.",
            "### Encoder-only Transformer\n\nThe transformer architecture, originally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, consists of both encoder and decoder components.  However, certain tasks don't require the full architecture.\n\n* **Sequence-to-Sequence of the Same Length:**  When the input and output sequences have the same length, only the encoder is necessary.  The output vectors (ùëß‚ÇÅ, ..., ùëßùë°) are derived directly from the encoder, allowing for direct loss computation. Examples include part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition.\n\n* **Sequence to Single Value:**  For tasks like sequence classification, where the output is a single value, the encoder is sufficient.  A special `[CLS]` token is prepended to the input sequence, and its corresponding output vector (ùëß‚ÇÅ) represents the entire sequence, used for computing the loss function.  Sentiment analysis is a typical example of such a task.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Google in 2018, is a powerful language model leveraging the encoder part of the transformer architecture. It comes in different sizes, with BERT-base (12 encoder blocks, 110M parameters) and BERT-large (24 encoder blocks, 340M parameters) being the most common. BERT's key strength lies in its ability to understand bidirectional context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words to understand the meaning of a word within a sentence. This is a significant advancement over traditional unidirectional language models.  BERT is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT Input Encoding\n\nBERT employs the WordPiece tokenizer, a subword tokenization method, to process input text.\n\n* **Subword Tokenization:** WordPiece breaks words into smaller units (subwords), allowing BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words and efficiently represent a wide range of vocabulary with a smaller vocabulary size.  Common words are treated as single tokens, while rarer words are split into constituent subwords.\n\n* **Vocabulary:**  WordPiece constructs a vocabulary of common words and subwords. For instance, \"unhappiness\" could be tokenized into \"un,\" \"happy,\" and \"##ness,\" where \"##\" signifies a subword continuing a previous word.\n\n* **Special Tokens:** BERT utilizes specific tokens: `[CLS]` at the beginning of each sequence for classification tasks and `[SEP]` to separate sentences within a sequence or mark the end of a single sentence.\n\n* **Token IDs:**  Each token is converted into a numerical ID corresponding to its position in the BERT vocabulary, which serves as the input to the model.\n\n**Advantages of WordPiece Embedding:**\n\n* **Handles Unseen Words:**  Facilitates the representation of rare or unknown words by breaking them into known subwords.\n* **Reduced Vocabulary Size:** Improves computational efficiency compared to character-level models.\n* **Captures Morphology:**  Helps capture morphological information by representing words through their subword components.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT [CLS] Token\n\nThe `[CLS]` token, prepended to every input sequence, serves as an aggregate representation of the entire sequence.  After processing the input, BERT's final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context of the sequence. This embedding is used for downstream tasks like classification.\n\n* **Single-Sentence Classification:**  The `[CLS]` embedding is directly fed into a classifier for tasks like sentiment analysis.\n\n* **Sentence-Pair Tasks:**  For tasks involving two sentences (e.g., question answering, paraphrase detection), the `[CLS]` embedding represents the relationship between the two sentences.",
            "### Practice on Token Classification and Named Entity Recognition\n\nThe provided Hugging Face tutorial (https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/2?fw=pt) offers practical guidance on using BERT for token classification and named entity recognition.  It recommends exploring different BERT versions, testing with custom prompts and public datasets like CoNLL-2003 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/eriktks/conll2003), and fine-tuning lightweight BERT versions when resources permit. This hands-on approach allows for practical experience with BERT's application in these crucial NLP tasks.  Experimenting with different models, datasets, and fine-tuning strategies will provide a deeper understanding of BERT's capabilities and limitations.  The Hugging Face ecosystem simplifies the process of leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 14: Decoder-only Transformers**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of decoder-only transformers, focusing on their architecture, applications, and prominent examples like GPT and LLaMA.  It explores the underlying mechanisms of text generation, training processes, and the advantages and limitations of these models.  Furthermore, it delves into specific details such as input encoding techniques and the evolution of different GPT versions, offering a comparative analysis between LLAMA and GPT.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Outline\n\n* Decoder-only transformer\n* GPT\n* LLAMA\n* Practice on text generation\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Decoder-only Transformer\n\nDecoder-only transformers, unlike the original transformer architecture which uses both encoder and decoder components, utilize only the decoder part. This architectural choice makes them particularly well-suited for autoregressive tasks, specifically text generation.  The absence of separate encoder layers simplifies the model and streamlines the process of generating text sequentially.  Tasks such as summarization and question answering, where the output is generated conditionally based on an input prompt, also benefit from this streamlined architecture.  Examples of successful decoder-only transformers include the GPT series and LLaMA.\n\nThe core principle behind text generation in decoder-only transformers is autoregression. This means generating text token by token, where each new token is predicted based on the preceding tokens in the sequence.  The input prompt and the generated text are treated as a single continuous sequence, enabling the model to implicitly \"encode\" the prompt's meaning while simultaneously \"decoding\" it into generated text. This unified approach eliminates the need for a separate encoder block.\n\nThe self-attention mechanism within decoder layers is crucial for context building.  However, a causal (unidirectional or forward) mask is applied to ensure that each token attends only to previous tokens, mimicking the natural flow of language generation.  This prevents the model from \"looking ahead\" at future tokens during training and generation.  This sequential processing allows the model to accumulate contextual information and learn complex relationships between tokens, effectively replacing the need for explicit encoder-decoder attention.",

            "### Introduction to Rasa (Detailed)\n\nRasa is an open-source conversational AI framework initially released in 2016. It is widely used for developing conversational assistants in multiple languages.\n\n**Rasa Building Blocks:**\n\n* **Intents:** Represent the user's goal or intention within a conversation.\n* **Entities:** Specific pieces of information relevant to the user's intent, such as dates, locations, or names.\n* **Actions:**  The bot's responses to user intents, which can range from simple text replies to complex custom actions.\n* **Responses:** Predefined text utterances used by the bot.\n* **Custom Actions:** Python code enabling complex interactions with external systems, databases, or APIs.\n* **Slots:** Variables that store information extracted from user input during the conversation.\n* **Forms:**  Structured ways to collect multiple pieces of information from the user by filling predefined slots.\n* **Stories:** Example conversation flows used for training the dialogue management model.  These define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions.  They act as training data for the dialogue model to learn how to respond in different scenarios.\n* **Rules:** Define short, specific conversation patterns that always follow the same path.  These are particularly useful for handling simple, predictable interactions.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Installing and Setting up Rasa\n\n1. **Virtual Environment:** Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies: `python -m venv rasa.env` and `source rasa.env/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `rasa.env\\Scripts\\activate` (Windows).  This prevents conflicts with other Python projects.\n\n2. **Rasa Installation:** Install Rasa within the virtual environment: `pip install rasa`.\n\n3. **Project Initialization:** Create a new Rasa project using: `rasa init`. This command generates a basic project structure with example files and configurations.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n### Rasa Project Structure\n\nA Rasa project follows a specific directory structure:\n\n* **`actions`:** Contains custom action code written in Python.  This directory houses the logic for actions that go beyond simple text responses, like interacting with external APIs or databases.\n\n* **`data`:** Stores the training data for NLU and dialogue management.  Key files include:\n    * **`nlu.yml`:** Defines intents, examples of user utterances, and entity annotations for training the NLU model.\n    * **`rules.yml`:** Defines rule-based dialogue flows for specific scenarios.\n    * **`stories.yml`:** Contains stories representing example conversation flows for training the dialogue management model.\n\n\n* **`models`:**  Stores the trained NLU and dialogue management models.\n\n* **`tests`:** Contains test cases for evaluating the chatbot's performance.\n\n* **`config.yml`:** Defines the NLU pipeline and dialogue management policies. This file configures the components used for processing user input and making decisions about the bot's responses. It includes settings for tokenizers, featurizers, intent classifiers, entity extractors, and dialogue policies.\n\n* **`credentials.yml`:** Stores credentials for connecting to external services like messaging platforms or databases.\n\n* **`domain.yml`:**  The central configuration file listing all intents, entities, slots, responses, forms, and actions.  It acts as a blueprint for the chatbot's capabilities.\n\n* **`endpoints.yml`:**  Configures the endpoints that the bot can use, such as action servers or messaging channels.",
            "### Key Rasa Files and Commands (Detailed)\n\n\n**`domain.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\nintents:\n- greet\n- goodbye\n- ...\n\nresponses:\n  utter_greet:\n  - text: \"Hey! How are you?\"\n  utter_goodbye:\n  - text: \"Bye\"\n  ...\n\nsession_config:\n  session_expiration_time: 60  # minutes\n  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true\n```\n\nThe `session_config` section manages conversation sessions. `session_expiration_time` defines the inactivity duration before a session expires. `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines if slot values are preserved across sessions.  This is useful for maintaining context if a user returns after a short break.\n\n**`nlu.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- intent: greet\n  examples: |\n    - hey\n    - hello\n    - hi\n    - ...\n```\n\nRasa requires a sufficient number of examples (7-10 minimum) per intent to effectively train the NLU model to recognize and classify user intentions.  These examples should cover variations in phrasing and vocabulary.\n\n**`stories.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- story: happy path\n  steps:\n  - intent: greet\n  - action: utter_greet\n  - intent: mood_great\n  - action: utter_happy\n```\n\nStories define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions. They serve as training data for the dialogue management model to learn appropriate responses in different conversational contexts.\n\n**`rules.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- rule: Say goodbye anytime the user says goodbye\n  steps:\n  - intent: goodbye\n  - action: utter_goodbye\n```\n\nRules specify simple, deterministic dialogue flows. Unlike stories, rules are not used for training a machine learning model; they are applied directly as hard-coded logic.\n\n\n**Visualizing Stories:**  Use `rasa visualize` to generate a graphical representation of the conversation flows defined in your stories. This helps in understanding and debugging the dialogue flow.\n\n\n**Rasa Commands:**\n\n* `rasa train`: Trains the NLU and dialogue management models using the data in the `data` directory and the configuration in `config.yml`.  The trained models are saved in the `models` directory.\n\n* `rasa shell`: Starts an interactive shell where you can test the trained chatbot by typing messages.  This allows you to interact with the bot and evaluate its responses in a controlled environment.\n\n* `rasa run`: Starts a server to deploy the chatbot, making it accessible via HTTP.  The `--cors \"*\" ` option enables cross-origin requests, allowing interaction from web applications hosted on different domains.\n\n* `rasa -h`: Displays help information and lists all available commands.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Rasa REST API\n\nRasa offers a REST API for integrating the chatbot with external systems.  This enables communication between your chatbot and web applications, mobile apps, or other services.\n\n* **REST Channel Configuration:** Add the REST channel to your `credentials.yml` file to enable the REST endpoint.  Restart the Rasa server for the changes to take effect.\n\n* **REST Endpoint:**  The bot becomes accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook` after configuring and restarting the server.

            "### What is Natural Language Processing?\n\n#### NLP's Growing Impact\n\nThe impact of NLP is increasingly evident in everyday life, with AI-powered tools like ChatGPT becoming mainstream.  These technologies have sparked widespread discussions about their potential to disrupt job markets, revolutionize information access, and reshape human-computer interaction.  Prominent figures like Bill Gates recognize this transformative potential, predicting significant global changes driven by advancements in NLP.\n\n#### The Importance of NLP in Artificial Intelligence\n\nLeading experts emphasize the central role of NLP in AI:\n\n* **John Searle (Philosopher):**  \"Natural language is the most important part of Artificial Intelligence.\" This highlights the fundamental importance of human language understanding for achieving true AI.\n* **Ginni Rometty (Former IBM CEO):** \"Natural language processing is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, allowing computers to read and understand human language, as well as to produce and recognize speech.\"  This underscores the practical applications of NLP in enabling human-computer communication.\n* **Dan Jurafsky (Stanford University):** \"Natural language processing is one of the most important fields in artificial intelligence and also one of the most difficult.\" This acknowledges the significant technical challenges inherent in developing effective NLP systems.\n\n#### Defining NLP\n\nVarious definitions capture the essence of NLP:\n\n* **Jacob Eisenstein:**  NLP encompasses the methods that enable computers to access and process human language.\n* **Christopher Manning:** NLP resides at the intersection of computer science and linguistics, leveraging insights from both fields.\n* **Behrooz Mansouri:** NLP empowers computers to understand natural language and perform tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering, mimicking human language capabilities.\n* **Natural Language Processing in Action:** NLP, a subfield of AI and computer science, translates natural language into a computationally usable format, enabling computers to learn from and generate text.\n\n\n#### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n\nNLU, a core component of NLP, transforms human language into a machine-readable format through processes like:\n\n* **Meaning Extraction:** Deciphering the semantic content of text.\n* **Contextual Analysis:**  Understanding the surrounding information that influences meaning.\n* **Intent Recognition:**  Identifying the purpose or goal behind a text.\n\nThis transformation often involves creating numerical representations called embeddings, used by various applications:\n\n* **Search Engines:** Interpreting search queries.\n* **Email Clients:** Filtering spam and categorizing emails.\n* **Social Media Platforms:** Moderating content and analyzing user sentiment.\n* **CRM Systems:** Analyzing customer inquiries and automating responses.\n* **Recommender Systems:**  Suggesting relevant content or products.\n\n\n#### Natural Language Generation (NLG)\n\nNLG, another key aspect of NLP, focuses on generating human-like text.  It involves constructing coherent and contextually relevant text from numerical representations:\n\n* **Machine Translation:** Converting text between languages.\n* **Text Summarization:** Condensing lengthy documents.\n* **Dialogue Processing:** Powering chatbots and virtual assistants.\n* **Content Creation:**  Generating various text formats, including articles, reports, and creative writing.\n\n\n\n#### Example: Conversational Agents\n\nConversational agents exemplify the integration of various NLP components, including speech recognition, language analysis, dialogue processing, information retrieval, and text-to-speech.  The iconic interaction between HAL and Dave in 2001: A Space Odyssey illustrates a fictional conversational agent:\n\n> \"Open the pod bay doors, Hal.\"\n>\n> \"I‚Äôm sorry, Dave, I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt do that.\"\n>\n> \"What are you talking about, Hal?\"\n>\n> \"I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.\"\n\n\n#### The Challenge of Ambiguity in NLP\n\nAmbiguity poses a significant hurdle for NLP.  The sentence \"I made her duck\" demonstrates how multiple interpretations can arise from a single sentence:\n\n* Cooking waterfowl for her.\n* Cooking waterfowl belonging to her.\n* Creating a duck object for her.\n* Causing her to lower her head or body.\n\n\n\n#### Levels of Ambiguity\n\nNatural language's richness and inherent ambiguity create various challenges for NLP:\n\n* **Lexical Ambiguity:** Words with multiple meanings (e.g., \"I saw bats\").\n* **Syntactic Ambiguity:** Different ways to parse a sentence structure (e.g., \"Call me a cab\").\n* **Interpreting Partial Information:** Resolving pronoun references.\n* **Contextual Ambiguity:**  The surrounding context influencing meaning.\n\n\n#### NLP's Relationship with Linguistics\n\nNLP draws upon several linguistic disciplines:\n\n* **Phonetics:** The study of speech sounds.\n* **Morphology:** The study of word formation.\n* **Syntax:** The study of sentence structure.\n* **Semantics:** The study of meaning.\n* **Pragmatics:** The study of language use in context.\n\n\n#### Distinguishing NLP from Linguistics\n\nWhile both fields deal with language, their focus differs:\n\n* **Linguistics:** Primarily studies the nature of language itself, exploring its structure, meaning, and usage. Computational linguistics uses computational methods to analyze linguistic phenomena.\n* **NLP:** Focuses on developing computational methods to process and utilize human language. It applies linguistic insights to build practical applications, such as machine translation and text summarization."

            "### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n\n**What is RLHF?**\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging human feedback to guide the learning process.  It aims to bridge the gap between objective model performance metrics and subjective human evaluations of desirable language generation, aligning model outputs with human values, preferences, and communication norms.\n\n**Why RLHF?**\n\nTraditional LLM training often relies heavily on large text corpora, which can lead to models that generate fluent but factually incorrect, biased, or unsafe outputs. RLHF addresses these limitations by directly incorporating human judgment into the training process. This results in models that are not only proficient in generating text but also better aligned with human expectations regarding safety, ethical considerations, and overall user satisfaction.\n\n**Workflow of RLHF**\n\n(See included image of workflow diagram)\n\nThe RLHF workflow typically involves three stages:\n\n1. **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):** An initial LLM is fine-tuned on a dataset of prompts and corresponding human-generated responses.  This stage instills a basic understanding of desired behavior in the model.\n\n2. **Reward Model Training:** A separate reward model is trained to score the quality of LLM-generated outputs. This model learns from human feedback, typically in the form of comparisons or rankings of different outputs for the same prompt.\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning:** The initial LLM is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning algorithms, guided by the reward model. The LLM learns to generate outputs that maximize the reward score, effectively aligning its behavior with human preferences.\n\n\n**Key components of RLHF**\n\n* **Pre-trained Language Model:** A foundational LLM, pre-trained on a massive text corpus, serves as the starting point.  Examples include BERT, GPT, and T5.  This pre-training provides the model with a general understanding of language structure and semantics.\n* **Reward Model:** A secondary model is trained to evaluate the quality of LLM outputs.  This model learns to predict human preference scores based on feedback provided on different generated outputs for the same prompt.\n* **Fine-Tuning with Reinforcement Learning:** The pre-trained LLM is further refined using reinforcement learning, typically using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  The reward model's scores serve as the reinforcement signal, guiding the LLM towards generating outputs that align with human preferences.\n\n**Reward model**\n\nThe training data for a reward model consists of:\n\n* Multiple LLM-generated outputs for a set of given prompts.\n* Corresponding human rankings or comparisons of these outputs, reflecting their preferences based on criteria such as factual accuracy, coherence, relevance, and safety.\n\nThe goal is to train a model capable of accurately predicting human preference scores for new, unseen LLM outputs.  The training process typically employs a ranking loss function that encourages the reward model to assign higher scores to outputs preferred by humans.\n\n**Fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**\n\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a commonly used reinforcement learning algorithm in RLHF.  The objective is to optimize the LLM to produce outputs that align with human-defined quality metrics, as captured by the reward model.  The process iteratively refines the LLM by:\n\n1. Generating responses to prompts using the current version of the LLM.\n2. Scoring these responses using the trained reward model.\n3. Updating the LLM's parameters to maximize the expected reward, effectively learning to produce higher-quality outputs according to human preferences.\n\n(See included image of PPO diagram)\n\n**Pros and Cons of RLHF**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Iterative Improvement:** RLHF allows for continuous improvement by incorporating new human feedback as the model evolves.  This iterative process enables the reward model and the LLM to be refined over time, leading to progressively better alignment with human preferences.\n* **Improved Alignment:**  RLHF directly incorporates human feedback, resulting in models that generate responses more closely aligned with human intent, preferences, and communication norms.\n* **Ethical Responses:** By incorporating human values, RLHF can mitigate the generation of harmful, biased, or unsafe outputs, promoting more responsible and ethical language generation.\n* **User-Centric Behavior:**  RLHF can tailor LLM interactions to individual user preferences, creating more personalized and satisfying user experiences.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Subjectivity:** Human feedback can be inherently subjective and vary significantly across individuals and demographics.  Managing this subjectivity is a key challenge in RLHF.\n* **Scalability:**  Collecting sufficient quantities of high-quality human feedback can be resource-intensive, requiring careful design of feedback collection mechanisms and potentially significant human effort.\n* **Reward Model Robustness:**  A misaligned or poorly trained reward model can negatively impact the fine-tuning process, leading to suboptimal LLM performance or even reinforcing undesirable behaviors.",
            "**Tasks to enhance with RLHF**\n\nRLHF can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including:\n\n* **Text Generation:** Improve the quality, creativity, and relevance of generated text.\n* **Dialogue Systems:** Enhance the naturalness, engagement, and helpfulness of conversational agents.\n* **Language Translation:** Increase translation accuracy and fluency, capturing nuances and stylistic preferences.\n* **Summarization:**  Generate more concise, informative, and insightful summaries.\n* **Question Answering:** Improve the accuracy and completeness of answers, addressing complex questions more effectively.\n* **Sentiment Analysis:** Tailor sentiment identification to specific domains or business needs, accounting for subtle variations in expression.\n* **Computer Programming:**  Assist in software development by generating code snippets, completing code, and suggesting improvements, based on natural language descriptions of desired functionality.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Case study: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4**\n\nOpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exemplify the successful application of RLHF. OpenAI reports that RLHF has led to:\n\n* **Enhanced alignment:** Better adherence to user instructions and expectations.\n* **Fewer unsafe outputs:**  Reduced generation of toxic, biased, or harmful content.\n* **More human-like interactions:**  Improved naturalness and engagement in conversational contexts.\n\nThese models, widely used in applications like ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical benefits of RLHF in real-world scenarios.  The ongoing iterative improvement of these models with additional human feedback underscores the importance of continuous refinement in RLHF.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n### Transformers TRL library\n\n**TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)**\n\nTRL is a comprehensive library designed specifically for training Transformer language models using reinforcement learning.  It provides a full suite of tools for implementing the key stages of RLHF, from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reward model training (RM) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  TRL seamlessly integrates with the Hugging Face Transformers library, simplifying the process of applying RLHF to existing Transformer models.\n\n(See included image of TRL steps diagram)",

While tools like Guardrails AI and LangChain can provide valuable functionalities for prompt management and basic filtering, they may not be sufficient for complex applications requiring advanced filtering, detection of malicious intent, or protection against adversarial attacks.  The context also emphasizes the importance of combining rule-based systems, machine learning classifiers, and continuous monitoring to build truly robust and reliable guardrails for LLMs.  It suggests exploring tools like SpaCy Matcher, ReLM patterns, and the LM evaluation harness for implementing more sophisticated rule-based filtering and evaluation mechanisms.  It further underscores the value of active learning and bug bounties for continuously improving the robustness of LLM guardrails and adapting to evolving challenges.\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 3: Math with Words**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\n\nThis lesson explores fundamental mathematical concepts and techniques used to represent and analyze text in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on methods that pave the way for working with Large Language Models.

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",

Examples include:\n\n* **Words:** \"The,\" \"quick,\" \"brown,\" \"fox.\"\n* **Punctuation Marks:** \".\", \",\", \"!\", \"?\". These can be important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure.\n* **Emojis:** üòÄ, üò≠.

Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.  A good tokenizer should correctly separate \"51\" and \".\" in a sentence like \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\"  We will explore more robust tokenization techniques later, including regular expressions and specialized tokenizers."

            "### Techniques for Adding Guardrails\n\nSeveral techniques can be employed individually or in combination to implement robust guardrails for LLMs:\n\n* **Rule-based Filters:**  Predefined rules that block or modify specific outputs based on keywords, regular expressions, or other criteria.  This is a simple and efficient technique for basic content filtering.\n* **Fine-tuning with Custom Data:** Training the model on curated datasets tailored to specific domains or applications. This adjusts the model's internal weights, guiding it towards generating more desirable outputs.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully crafting prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and constrain its responses within desired boundaries. This involves providing explicit instructions within the prompt to shape the model's output.\n* **External Validation Layers:** Utilizing external systems or APIs to post-process the LLM's output. This allows for modular and scalable implementation of guardrails, leveraging specialized tools for tasks like toxicity detection or fact-checking.\n* **Real-time Monitoring and Feedback:**  Continuously monitoring LLM outputs for unsafe or incorrect content, allowing for real-time intervention through flagging or blocking problematic responses.  This can involve human-in-the-loop systems or automated anomaly detection.\n\n**Examples of Techniques:**\n\n* **Rule-based Filters:** Blocking offensive terms or filtering sensitive information using regular expressions.\n* **Fine-tuning:**  Fine-tuning an LLM on medical data to restrict responses to accurate and safe medical advice.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Including instructions like \"Respond only with factual information\" within the prompt.\n* **External Validation Layers:**  Integrating a toxicity detection API to filter out toxic or harmful language.\n* **Real-time Monitoring:**  Employing human reviewers to monitor LLM outputs and provide feedback for continuous improvement.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Best Practices\n\nCombining multiple techniques often yields the most robust safeguards.  For instance, integrating rule-based filtering with external validation and fine-tuning creates a layered approach to ensuring LLM safety and reliability.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Frameworks for Implementing Guardrails\n\nSpecialized frameworks simplify the implementation of guardrails, offering pre-built functionalities and easy integration with LLM APIs:\n\n* **Guardrails AI:** Provides tools for validation, formatting, and filtering LLM outputs.\n* **LangChain:** Enables chaining prompts and integrating validation and filtering steps into the LLM workflow.\n* **OpenAI Moderation:** A pre-built API for detecting unsafe content, readily integrable with OpenAI LLMs.\n\n**Guardrails AI (https://www.guardrailsai.com/)**\n\nThis library offers functionalities for validating outputs against predefined guidelines, formatting outputs according to specified structures, and filtering out unsafe content.\n\n```python\nfrom guardrails import Guard\nguard = Guard(rules=\"rules.yaml\")\nresponse = guard(llm(\"Provide medical advice\"))\n```\n\n**LangChain**\n\nThis framework allows chaining prompts with checks and filters, verifying outputs against predefined criteria.

This eliminates the need for extensive retraining and allows for rapid adaptation to new tasks.\n\nA prompt context for in-context learning may specify:\n\n* **Reference Material:** Specific text or data to be used to perform the task. This provides the LLM with the necessary information to answer questions or generate relevant content.\n* **Input-Output Pairs:** Examples of the task to illustrate the desired pattern.  Demonstrating the expected input-output relationship guides the LLM towards the correct behavior.\n* **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Detailed guidance for completing the task.

We will cover tokenization, bag-of-words representation, token normalization techniques, stemming and lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and introduce the spaCy library.",
            "### Outline\n\n1. Tokenization:  Breaking down text into individual units.\n2. Bag of Words Representation:  Representing text as a collection of words and their frequencies.\n3. Token Normalization: Cleaning and standardizing tokens.\n4. Stemming and Lemmatization:  Reducing words to their root forms.\n5. Part of Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical labels to tokens.\n6. Introducing spaCy:  An overview of a powerful NLP library in Python.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Tokenization\n\n**Preparing the Environment**\n\nJupyter notebooks (installable through `pip install jupyter` and the Jupyter extension for VS Code) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) are recommended for the exercises.  A virtual environment (`python -m venv .env` and `source .env/bin/activate`) is good practice for managing dependencies.  The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are required (`pip install numpy pandas`).\n\n**Text Segmentation**\n\nText segmentation divides text into meaningful units at different levels:\n\n* **Paragraph Segmentation:** Dividing a document into paragraphs.  This often relies on visual cues like line breaks or indentation.\n* **Sentence Segmentation:**  Splitting paragraphs into sentences. This typically uses punctuation like periods, question marks, and exclamation points.\n* **Word Segmentation:** Separating sentences into individual words.  This can be complex due to punctuation, contractions, and language-specific rules.\n\nTokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation, breaking text into units called tokens.\n\n**What is a Token?**\n\nA token is the smallest meaningful unit of text considered by an NLP system. Examples include:\n\n* **Words:** \"The,\" \"quick,\" \"brown,\" \"fox.\"\n* **Punctuation Marks:** \".\", \",\", \"!\", \"?\". These can be important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure.\n* **Emojis:** üòÄ, üò≠. These convey emotional information.\n* **Numbers:** \"123,\" \"3.14.\"  These can represent quantities or other numerical data.\n* **Sub-words:** \"pre-,\" \"re-,\" \"-ing,\" \"-ed.\"  These can help with handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological information.\n* **Phrases:** \"ice cream,\" \"New York.\"  These represent multi-word expressions that function as a single unit.\n\n**Tokenizer Implementation**\n\nWhile using whitespace as delimiters seems simple, it's inadequate for languages without clear word boundaries (e.g., Chinese).  Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.  A good tokenizer should correctly separate \"51\" and \".\" in a sentence like \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\"  We will explore more robust tokenization techniques later, including regular expressions and specialized tokenizers."

            "### Adding Guardrails to LLMs\n\n**What are Guardrails?**\n\nGuardrails are essential mechanisms and policies that govern the behavior of LLMs. They act as a safety net, ensuring that the model's responses are safe, accurate, relevant to the context, and align with desired ethical and operational guidelines.  Without guardrails, LLMs can be prone to generating harmful, biased, inaccurate, or inappropriate content.  Implementing guardrails is a critical step in building trust and reliability, paving the way for responsible LLM integration into real-world applications.\n\n**Benefits of Guardrails:**\n\n* **Mitigating Risks:** Preventing the generation of harmful, biased, or inaccurate outputs safeguards users and maintains the integrity of the application.\n* **Enforcing Ethical Standards:**  Aligning responses with ethical guidelines ensures fairness, avoids discrimination, and promotes responsible AI usage.\n* **Meeting Operational Objectives:** Guardrails help maintain control over LLM outputs, aligning them with specific business or user objectives and preventing undesirable behaviors.\n* **Building Trust and Reliability:**  Demonstrating responsible AI practices through the implementation of guardrails builds trust among users and stakeholders.\n\n**Examples of Guardrail Implementation:**\n\n* **Content Filtering:** Blocking harmful or inappropriate content like hate speech, profanity, or personally identifiable information.\n* **Domain Restriction:**  Confining LLM outputs to specific knowledge domains, preventing the model from venturing into areas where its knowledge is limited or unreliable.\n\n**Types of Guardrails:**\n\n* **Safety Guardrails:**  Focus on preventing the generation of harmful or offensive content, prioritizing user safety and well-being.\n* **Domain-Specific Guardrails:**  Restrict responses to defined knowledge areas, ensuring accuracy and relevance within the intended scope.\n* **Ethical Guardrails:**  Address concerns related to bias, misinformation, and fairness, promoting responsible AI practices.\n* **Operational Guardrails:**  Control outputs to align with specific business rules, user objectives, or application requirements.",
            "### Techniques for Adding Guardrails\n\nSeveral techniques can be employed individually or in combination to implement robust guardrails for LLMs:\n\n* **Rule-based Filters:**  Predefined rules that block or modify specific outputs based on keywords, regular expressions, or other criteria.  This is a simple and efficient technique for basic content filtering.\n* **Fine-tuning with Custom Data:** Training the model on curated datasets tailored to specific domains or applications. This adjusts the model's internal weights, guiding it towards generating more desirable outputs.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully crafting prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and constrain its responses within desired boundaries. This involves providing explicit instructions within the prompt to shape the model's output.\n* **External Validation Layers:** Utilizing external systems or APIs to post-process the LLM's output. This allows for modular and scalable implementation of guardrails, leveraging specialized tools for tasks like toxicity detection or fact-checking.\n* **Real-time Monitoring and Feedback:**  Continuously monitoring LLM outputs for unsafe or incorrect content, allowing for real-time intervention through flagging or blocking problematic responses.  This can involve human-in-the-loop systems or automated anomaly detection.\n\n**Examples of Techniques:**\n\n* **Rule-based Filters:** Blocking offensive terms or filtering sensitive information using regular expressions.\n* **Fine-tuning:**  Fine-tuning an LLM on medical data to restrict responses to accurate and safe medical advice.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Including instructions like \"Respond only with factual information\" within the prompt.\n* **External Validation Layers:**  Integrating a toxicity detection API to filter out toxic or harmful language.\n* **Real-time Monitoring:**  Employing human reviewers to monitor LLM outputs and provide feedback for continuous improvement.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Best Practices\n\nCombining multiple techniques often yields the most robust safeguards.  For instance, integrating rule-based filtering with external validation and fine-tuning creates a layered approach to ensuring LLM safety and reliability.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Frameworks for Implementing Guardrails\n\nSpecialized frameworks simplify the implementation of guardrails, offering pre-built functionalities and easy integration with LLM APIs:\n\n* **Guardrails AI:** Provides tools for validation, formatting, and filtering LLM outputs.\n* **LangChain:** Enables chaining prompts and integrating validation and filtering steps into the LLM workflow.\n* **OpenAI Moderation:** A pre-built API for detecting unsafe content, readily integrable with OpenAI LLMs.\n\n**Guardrails AI (https://www.guardrailsai.com/)**\n\nThis library offers functionalities for validating outputs against predefined guidelines, formatting outputs according to specified structures, and filtering out unsafe content.\n\n```python\nfrom guardrails import Guard\nguard = Guard(rules=\"rules.yaml\")\nresponse = guard(llm(\"Provide medical advice\"))\n```\n\n**LangChain**\n\nThis framework allows chaining prompts with checks and filters, verifying outputs against predefined criteria.

            "### Introduction to RAG\n\n**What is RAG?**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) possess broad reasoning capabilities, yet they face inherent limitations:\n\n* **Knowledge Cutoff:**  Their knowledge is confined to the data they were trained on.  This creates a \"cutoff\" date beyond which they are unaware of new information, world events, or evolving scientific understanding.\n* **Inability to Access External Information:** LLMs, in their standard form, operate in isolation and cannot access real-time information from the internet or other external sources. This restricts their ability to respond to queries requiring current data.\n* **Handling Private and Proprietary Data:**  Standard LLMs are not designed to process private or proprietary information.  Submitting such data to publicly available LLMs poses security risks and potential breaches of confidentiality.\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by enriching LLMs with access to external and private data sources. This technique allows AI applications to leverage the power of LLMs while grounding their responses in specific, relevant information, broadening their knowledge beyond the training data and enabling them to work with sensitive data securely.\n\n\n**RAG Concepts**\n\nRAG applications typically involve two key stages:\n\n* **Indexing (Offline):**  This process involves ingesting data from various sources and preparing it for efficient retrieval.  The data is transformed into a searchable format, often involving splitting large documents into smaller, manageable chunks and converting them into vector representations.\n* **Retrieval and Generation (Runtime):** When a user submits a query, the system retrieves relevant information from the indexed data. This retrieved context is then integrated into a prompt that is fed to the LLM.  The LLM, now armed with pertinent information, generates a more informed and contextually appropriate response.\n\n\n**Indexing**\n\nThe indexing stage consists of three main steps:\n\n* **Load:**  Data is loaded from various sources, including files (PDF, CSV, HTML, JSON), websites, databases, and other repositories.  RAG frameworks often provide specialized loaders to handle different data formats.\n* **Split (Chunking):**  Long documents are divided into smaller chunks.  This is crucial for two reasons: (1) smaller chunks are easier to search and retrieve efficiently, and (2) they fit within the limited context window of LLMs.\n* **Store (Vectorization):**  The data chunks are stored in a Vector Store. This involves converting text chunks into vector representations (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based search.\n\n\n**Vector Stores**\n\nVector Stores are specialized databases designed for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.\n\n* **Embeddings Recap:** Embeddings are mathematical representations of text that capture semantic relationships between words and phrases.  Similar concepts have similar vector representations.\n* **Semantic Search:** Vector stores enable semantic search, where retrieval is based on the meaning of the query and the indexed data, rather than just keyword matching. This allows for more accurate and relevant retrieval of information.\n\n\n**Retrieval and Generation**\n\nThe runtime process involves:\n\n* **Retrieval:** Based on the user's query, the system retrieves the most relevant data chunks from the Vector Store, using similarity search based on embeddings.\n* **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved data is incorporated into a prompt along with the user's query.\n* **LLM Generation:** This augmented prompt is fed to the LLM, enabling it to generate a response grounded in the retrieved context."

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",

            "### Elements of a Prompt\n\nA well-structured prompt typically comprises the following elements:\n\n* **Instruction:** A specific task or instruction you want the model to perform. This clearly directs the LLM towards the desired action.\n* **Context:** External information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses.  Providing background information or relevant details helps the LLM generate more informed and relevant outputs.\n* **Input Data:** The input or question that we are interested in finding a response for.  This is the data upon which the LLM will operate.\n* **Output Indicator:** The type or format of the output.  Specifying the desired output format, such as a list, paragraph, or code snippet, helps structure the LLM's response.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n* **Instruction:** Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive.\n* **Input Data:** Text: I think the vacation is okay.\n* **Output Indicator:** Sentiment:\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n* **Instruction:** Answer the question based on the context below. Keep the answer short and concise. Respond \"Unsure about answer\" if not sure.\n* **Context:** Teplizumab traces its roots to a New Jersey drug company called Ortho Pharmaceutical. There, scientists generated an early version of the antibody, dubbed OKT3. Originally sourced from mice, the molecule was able to bind to the surface of T cells and limit their cell-killing potential. In 1986, it was approved to help prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, making it the first therapeutic antibody allowed for human use.\n* **Input Data:** Question: What was OKT3 originally sourced from?\n* **Output Indicator:** Answer:\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### In-Context Learning\n\nIn-context learning is a powerful capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting and leveraging information provided directly within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters. This eliminates the need for extensive retraining and allows for rapid adaptation to new tasks.\n\nA prompt context for in-context learning may specify:\n\n* **Reference Material:** Specific text or data to be used to perform the task. This provides the LLM with the necessary information to answer questions or generate relevant content.\n* **Input-Output Pairs:** Examples of the task to illustrate the desired pattern.  Demonstrating the expected input-output relationship guides the LLM towards the correct behavior.\n* **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Detailed guidance for completing the task.  Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps helps the LLM follow the desired process.\n* **Clarifications:** Addressing potential ambiguities in the task.  Removing any ambiguity ensures that the LLM correctly interprets the intended meaning.\n* **Templates:** Structures or placeholders to be filled in.  Templates provide a framework for the LLM's response, ensuring consistent formatting and structure.\n\nPrompt engineering heavily leverages in-context learning to efficiently guide LLMs towards desired behaviors without requiring retraining.",

            "### Techniques for Adding Guardrails\n\nSeveral techniques can be employed individually or in combination to implement robust guardrails for LLMs:\n\n* **Rule-based Filters:**  Predefined rules that block or modify specific outputs based on keywords, regular expressions, or other criteria.  This is a simple and efficient technique for basic content filtering.\n* **Fine-tuning with Custom Data:** Training the model on curated datasets tailored to specific domains or applications. This adjusts the model's internal weights, guiding it towards generating more desirable outputs.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully crafting prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and constrain its responses within desired boundaries. This involves providing explicit instructions within the prompt to shape the model's output.\n* **External Validation Layers:** Utilizing external systems or APIs to post-process the LLM's output. This allows for modular and scalable implementation of guardrails, leveraging specialized tools for tasks like toxicity detection or fact-checking.\n* **Real-time Monitoring and Feedback:**  Continuously monitoring LLM outputs for unsafe or incorrect content, allowing for real-time intervention through flagging or blocking problematic responses.  This can involve human-in-the-loop systems or automated anomaly detection.\n\n**Examples of Techniques:**\n\n* **Rule-based Filters:** Blocking offensive terms or filtering sensitive information using regular expressions.\n* **Fine-tuning:**  Fine-tuning an LLM on medical data to restrict responses to accurate and safe medical advice.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Including instructions like \"Respond only with factual information\" within the prompt.\n* **External Validation Layers:**  Integrating a toxicity detection API to filter out toxic or harmful language.\n* **Real-time Monitoring:**  Employing human reviewers to monitor LLM outputs and provide feedback for continuous improvement.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Best Practices\n\nCombining multiple techniques often yields the most robust safeguards.  For instance, integrating rule-based filtering with external validation and fine-tuning creates a layered approach to ensuring LLM safety and reliability.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Frameworks for Implementing Guardrails\n\nSpecialized frameworks simplify the implementation of guardrails, offering pre-built functionalities and easy integration with LLM APIs:\n\n* **Guardrails AI:** Provides tools for validation, formatting, and filtering LLM outputs.\n* **LangChain:** Enables chaining prompts and integrating validation and filtering steps into the LLM workflow.\n* **OpenAI Moderation:** A pre-built API for detecting unsafe content, readily integrable with OpenAI LLMs.\n\n**Guardrails AI (https://www.guardrailsai.com/)**\n\nThis library offers functionalities for validating outputs against predefined guidelines, formatting outputs according to specified structures, and filtering out unsafe content.\n\n```python\nfrom guardrails import Guard\nguard = Guard(rules=\"rules.yaml\")\nresponse = guard(llm(\"Provide medical advice\"))\n```\n\n**LangChain**\n\nThis framework allows chaining prompts with checks and filters, verifying outputs against predefined criteria.  It also offers integration with Guardrails AI.\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"question\"],\n    template=\"Answer safely and factually: {question}\"\n)\n```\n\n* Chains prompts with checks and filters.\n* Verifies outputs against predefined criteria.\n* Integrable with Guardrails: https://www.guardrailsai.com/docs/integrations/langchain",

            "### Adding Guardrails to LLMs\n\n**What are Guardrails?**\n\nGuardrails are essential mechanisms and policies that govern the behavior of LLMs. They act as a safety net, ensuring that the model's responses are safe, accurate, relevant to the context, and align with desired ethical and operational guidelines.  Without guardrails, LLMs can be prone to generating harmful, biased, inaccurate, or inappropriate content.  Implementing guardrails is a critical step in building trust and reliability, paving the way for responsible LLM integration into real-world applications.\n\n**Benefits of Guardrails:**\n\n* **Mitigating Risks:** Preventing the generation of harmful, biased, or inaccurate outputs safeguards users and maintains the integrity of the application.\n* **Enforcing Ethical Standards:**  Aligning responses with ethical guidelines ensures fairness, avoids discrimination, and promotes responsible AI usage.\n* **Meeting Operational Objectives:** Guardrails help maintain control over LLM outputs, aligning them with specific business or user objectives and preventing undesirable behaviors.\n* **Building Trust and Reliability:**  Demonstrating responsible AI practices through the implementation of guardrails builds trust among users and stakeholders.\n\n**Examples of Guardrail Implementation:**\n\n* **Content Filtering:** Blocking harmful or inappropriate content like hate speech, profanity, or personally identifiable information.\n* **Domain Restriction:**  Confining LLM outputs to specific knowledge domains, preventing the model from venturing into areas where its knowledge is limited or unreliable.\n\n**Types of Guardrails:**\n\n* **Safety Guardrails:**  Focus on preventing the generation of harmful or offensive content, prioritizing user safety and well-being.\n* **Domain-Specific Guardrails:**  Restrict responses to defined knowledge areas, ensuring accuracy and relevance within the intended scope.\n* **Ethical Guardrails:**  Address concerns related to bias, misinformation, and fairness, promoting responsible AI practices.\n* **Operational Guardrails:**  Control outputs to align with specific business rules, user objectives, or application requirements.",

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",
            "#### RNN Variants\n\nSeveral variants of RNNs have been developed to address limitations and improve performance:\n\n* **Bidirectional RNN:** Processes the sequence both forward and backward.  The outputs from the forward and backward passes are concatenated at each time step.  This allows the network to capture information from both past and future context, which can be beneficial for tasks like named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.\n* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**  Addresses the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in training RNNs where gradients become very small during backpropagation, hindering learning. LSTMs introduce a memory cell and gates (input, output, and forget gates) to control information flow and maintain long-term dependencies.\n* **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** A simpler alternative to LSTM, also designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. GRUs use update and reset gates to control the flow of information. They often achieve comparable performance to LSTMs with fewer parameters, making them computationally more efficient.\n* **Stacked LSTM/GRU:** Multiple LSTM or GRU layers can be stacked on top of each other. This allows the network to learn hierarchical representations of the sequence, with higher layers capturing more complex patterns.\n\n\n#### Using Ragged Tensors\n\nRagged tensors are data structures designed to efficiently handle variable-length sequences, eliminating the need for padding. TensorFlow and similar deep learning frameworks provide support for ragged tensors. PyTorch offers similar functionality through Packed Sequences. These structures optimize memory usage and computational efficiency during training and inference.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Building a Spam Detector\n\nThis section requires an implementation of a spam detector using RNNs, ideally with code examples.  The original text does not provide details on this implementation.  A basic example using a simple RNN or LSTM to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their text content would be beneficial.\n\n```python\n# Example (Illustrative -  Requires further development)\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\n# Define the RNN model\nclass SpamDetector(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)\n        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()\n\n    def forward(self, text, text_lengths):\n        embedded = self.embedding(text)\n        packed_embedded = nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(embedded, text_lengths, enforce_sorted=False)\n        packed_output, (hidden, cell) = self.rnn(packed_embedded)\n        output, output_lengths = nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence(packed_output)\n        hidden = hidden[-1, :, :] # get last hidden state\n        output = self.fc(hidden)\n        return self.sigmoid(output)\n\n# Example usage (Illustrative)\nvocab_size = 10000  # Replace with actual vocabulary size\nembedding_dim = 100\nhidden_dim = 256\noutput_dim = 1 # Binary classification (spam/not spam)\n\nmodel = SpamDetector(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)\n\n# ...  (Training loop and data preprocessing would go here)\n```",
            "### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n\nLoRA operates on the principle that the changes needed to adapt a pre-trained model to a new task can be effectively captured by a low-rank representation.  This allows for substantial parameter savings while maintaining performance.\n\n1. **Base Model Weights (W):** The pre-trained transformer model is characterized by its weight matrices *W*.\n2. **Low-Rank Decomposition (ŒîW = A √ó B):**  Instead of directly modifying *W*, LoRA learns a low-rank decomposition of the weight update Œî*W*. This update is represented as the product of two low-rank matrices, *A* (m√ór) and *B* (r√ón), where *r* is the rank, significantly smaller than the dimensions *m* and *n* of *W*.\n3. **Weight Update (W' = W + ŒîW):** During fine-tuning, the effective weight matrix *W'* is computed as the sum of the original weights *W* and the low-rank update Œî*W*.\n\n**How LoRA Works:**\n\n* **Frozen Pre-trained Weights:**  The original weights *W* remain frozen, preserving the general knowledge acquired during pre-training.\n* **Task-Specific Knowledge Injection:** The low-rank matrices *A* and *B* encode the task-specific knowledge, requiring significantly fewer parameters than updating the full weight matrix.\n* **Parameter Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is dramatically reduced, making LoRA highly efficient.\n* **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the low-rank update can be efficiently applied to the frozen weights, ensuring fast and memory-efficient deployment.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Adapters\n\nAdapters are small, pluggable modules integrated within the Transformer architecture. They introduce task-specific parameters while keeping the original model parameters frozen, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency.  Adapters are trained to learn task-specific representations, while the pre-trained model provides a robust and general foundation.  This modularity also facilitates multi-task learning.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Prefix Tuning\n\nPrefix Tuning optimizes a small set of continuous prefix vectors that are prepended to the input sequence. These prefixes guide the model's attention mechanism, allowing it to adapt to different tasks without modifying the underlying model weights.  This approach is highly parameter-efficient, as only the prefix vectors are trained. The length of the prefix sequence controls the trade-off between task-specific expressiveness and parameter efficiency.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Instruction Fine-Tuning\n\nInstruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and respond to user instructions by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples.

The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",

They leverage the attention mechanism to capture dependencies between input and output sequences, enabling effective handling of long-range dependencies and contextual information. This architecture contrasts with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process sequences sequentially and can struggle with long-range dependencies.\n\nThe encoder processes the input sequence, transforming it into a set of hidden representations that capture the meaning and context of the input. The decoder then takes these representations and generates the output sequence, one token at a time, while attending to relevant parts of the encoded input. This attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input when generating each output token, leading to improved performance, especially in tasks like machine translation.",

            "### Stemming and Lemmatization\n\n**Stemming:**\n\nStemming reduces words to their root form (stem) by heuristically removing prefixes and suffixes.  While efficient, it can produce non-words (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"runn\").  The Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer (multilingual support) are common stemming algorithms available in NLTK.\n\n**Lemmatization:**\n\nLemmatization, a more sophisticated approach, uses dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine a word's canonical form (lemma), considering its part of speech.  This always results in a valid word (e.g., \"better\" becomes \"good\"). Lemmatization is generally more accurate but computationally slower than stemming.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Part of Speech (PoS) Tagging\n\nPoS tagging assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to tokens, providing valuable information about sentence structure and word function.  This is crucial for tasks like lemmatization, parsing, and named entity recognition.  PoS tagging is inherently ambiguous due to words having multiple possible tags depending on context.  Algorithms use dictionaries, statistical models, and contextual information to disambiguate and assign the most likely tags. NLTK offers pre-trained PoS tagging models.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Introducing spaCy\n\nspaCy is a powerful open-source Python library for advanced NLP. It provides pre-trained language models with functionalities like tokenization, PoS tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, and NER.  spaCy offers detailed token attributes (e.g., `is_stop`, `pos_`, `lemma_`), simplifies common NLP tasks, and includes a built-in visualizer (displaCy) for analyzing syntactic dependencies and named entities.  spaCy's NER identifies and classifies real-world objects (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) with specific labels.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### References\n\n* *Natural Language Processing in Action: Understanding, Analyzing, and Generating Text with Python*, Chapter 2 (excluding 2.3).\n\n### Further Readings\n\n* spaCy 101: https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101\n* NLTK Documentation: https://www.nltk.org/\n\n\nThis enhanced version maintains all original information while significantly expanding on the core concepts with additional context, examples, and explanations for improved clarity and depth.

This means that the RNN will process the text one character at a time, learning the statistical relationships between characters in Leopardi's writing style.\n\n#### Extract the Training Samples\n\nThe corpus is divided into sequences of characters of a fixed length (maxlen). Each sequence serves as input to the RNN, and the next character in the corpus following the sequence is the target output.\n\n\n#### Build and Train the Model\n\nAn LSTM model is trained to predict the next character in the sequence.  The choice of LSTM is motivated by its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is relevant for modeling the complexities of poetic language.\n\n```python\n# Example (Illustrative - Requires further development)\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass PoetryGenerator(nn.Module):\n  # ...

Examples include casual conversation bots and entertainment-focused chatbots.\n\n* **Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems (TOD):**  TOD systems are designed to assist users in accomplishing specific tasks. They prioritize understanding user requests, tracking the conversation's context, and generating actions to fulfill the user's goal.  Efficiency is key, aiming to minimize the number of conversational turns needed to complete the task. Examples include booking flights, scheduling meetings, providing information, and controlling smart home devices.\n\n**Examples of Task-Oriented Dialogue:**\n\n* **Information Retrieval:** \"Which room is the dialogue tutorial in?\" or \"When is the IJCNLP 2017 conference?\"\n* **Task Completion:** \"Book me a flight from Seattle to Taipei.\" or \"Schedule a meeting with Bill at 10:00 tomorrow.\"\n* **Recommendation:** \"Can you suggest me a restaurant?\" or \"Can you suggest me something to see near me?\"",

Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",

It begins by explaining the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which motivated the development of Transformers.  Following this, the core components of the Transformer model are detailed, focusing on the mechanism of self-attention.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Limitations of RNNs**\n\nRNNs, while powerful for sequential data processing, face several inherent limitations that hinder their performance, especially with long sequences:\n\n* **Vanishing Gradients:** This problem arises during backpropagation through time (BPTT), the algorithm used to train RNNs.  As gradients are propagated back through the network, they can diminish exponentially, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The repeated multiplication of small derivative values during BPTT leads to the vanishing gradient, effectively preventing the network from adjusting its weights based on earlier parts of the sequence.\n\n* **Slow Training:** RNNs process data sequentially, meaning they handle one input at a time.  This inherent sequentiality prevents the network from leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, resulting in significantly slower training times, especially for long sequences.  The network must complete processing ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 before starting on ùë•ùëñ, creating a bottleneck.\n\n* **Limited Long-Term Memory:** RNNs struggle to retain information from earlier stages of the sequence when processing long sequences. Information from the beginning of a sequence is gradually lost as the network proceeds, making it difficult for the model to understand and utilize context over extended spans of text. This is typically represented by a context vector, which has a fixed size and thus cannot effectively store information from arbitrarily long sequences.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Transformer**\n\nIntroduced by Google Brain in 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by addressing the shortcomings of RNNs. It enables parallel processing of sequence elements, significantly speeding up training and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. The number of layers traversed is independent of the sequence length, contributing to its efficiency and ability to handle long-range dependencies. While initially designed for machine translation, its components are adaptable to various NLP tasks.",

It recommends exploring different BERT versions, testing with custom prompts and public datasets like CoNLL-2003 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/eriktks/conll2003), and fine-tuning lightweight BERT versions when resources permit. This hands-on approach allows for practical experience with BERT's application in these crucial NLP tasks.  Experimenting with different models, datasets, and fine-tuning strategies will provide a deeper understanding of BERT's capabilities and limitations.  The Hugging Face ecosystem simplifies the process of leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 14: Decoder-only Transformers**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of decoder-only transformers, focusing on their architecture, applications, and prominent examples like GPT and LLaMA.  It explores the underlying mechanisms of text generation, training processes, and the advantages and limitations of these models.  Furthermore, it delves into specific details such as input encoding techniques and the evolution of different GPT versions, offering a comparative analysis between LLAMA and GPT.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Outline\n\n* Decoder-only transformer\n* GPT\n* LLAMA\n* Practice on text generation\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Decoder-only Transformer\n\nDecoder-only transformers, unlike the original transformer architecture which uses both encoder and decoder components, utilize only the decoder part. This architectural choice makes them particularly well-suited for autoregressive tasks, specifically text generation.  The absence of separate encoder layers simplifies the model and streamlines the process of generating text sequentially.  Tasks such as summarization and question answering, where the output is generated conditionally based on an input prompt, also benefit from this streamlined architecture.  Examples of successful decoder-only transformers include the GPT series and LLaMA.\n\nThe core principle behind text generation in decoder-only transformers is autoregression. This means generating text token by token, where each new token is predicted based on the preceding tokens in the sequence.  The input prompt and the generated text are treated as a single continuous sequence, enabling the model to implicitly \"encode\" the prompt's meaning while simultaneously \"decoding\" it into generated text. This unified approach eliminates the need for a separate encoder block.\n\nThe self-attention mechanism within decoder layers is crucial for context building.  However, a causal (unidirectional or forward) mask is applied to ensure that each token attends only to previous tokens, mimicking the natural flow of language generation.  This prevents the model from \"looking ahead\" at future tokens during training and generation.  This sequential processing allows the model to accumulate contextual information and learn complex relationships between tokens, effectively replacing the need for explicit encoder-decoder attention."

            "**Transformer Components**\n\nThe Transformer model comprises several key components:\n\n* **Input:** The raw textual data.\n* **Tokenization:**  The process of breaking down the input text into individual units, or tokens (words, subwords, or characters). Each token is then assigned a unique numerical identifier.\n* **Input Embedding:**  Tokens are represented as dense vectors in a continuous Euclidean space. This embedding captures semantic relationships between words, placing similar words closer together and dissimilar words further apart.\n* **Positional Encoding:**  Since the attention mechanism is order-agnostic, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings.  These encodings provide information about the position of each token in the sequence, enabling the model to understand word order.\n* **Encoder:** Processes the input sequence to generate an intermediate representation. It consists of multiple identical layers, each employing self-attention and a feed-forward network.\n* **Decoder:** Generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation. It also uses masked self-attention to prevent \"peeking\" at future tokens during training.\n* **Output:** The generated sequence of tokens, which can then be converted back to text.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Input: Tokenization**\n\nTokenization is a fundamental step in NLP.

This process allows the model to represent and process textual data in a structured manner.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Input Embedding**\n\nWord embeddings are crucial for representing words in a format that machine learning models can understand. They project tokens into a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.  Similar words tend to have similar vector representations, allowing the model to learn meaningful associations.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Positional Encoding**\n\nThe attention mechanism, while powerful, doesn't inherently consider word order.  Positional encodings address this limitation by adding position-specific information to the input embeddings. These encodings utilize periodic functions (sine and cosine) to create unique representations for each position.  This ensures that the model differentiates between sequences with the same words in different orders.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Encoder**\n\nThe encoder transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation.  It consists of stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer.  Crucially, the encoder processes all input tokens in parallel, a key advantage over sequential RNNs.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Self Attention**\n\nSelf-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when encoding a specific word.  It helps the model understand relationships between words within the same sentence.  For example, in the sentence \"The animal didn‚Äôt cross the street because it was too wide,\" self-attention helps the model associate \"it\" with \"the street\" rather than \"the animal.\"\n\nThe attention mechanism employs three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).  These matrices are derived from the input embeddings through linear transformations.  The attention weights are calculated using scaled dot-product attention, which measures the similarity between query and key vectors.  These weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the input sequence.  The scaling factor (1/‚àödk) is crucial for preventing extremely small gradients during training, especially with high-dimensional vectors.",
            "### TOD System Architecture\n\nA typical TOD system consists of three core modules:\n\n* **Input Modules (\"Ears\"):** This module is responsible for receiving and interpreting user input. It typically includes Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components to extract meaning from text and may also incorporate Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements for structured input.\n\n* **Dialogue Management (\"Brain\"):**  This is the central component that controls the conversation flow.  It manages the conversation's context, stores user-specific information, interacts with backend systems (databases, APIs, and other services), and connects to various conversational platforms. This module determines the appropriate actions based on the user input and the current dialogue state.\n\n* **Output Modules (\"Mouth\"):** This module generates the system's responses. It uses Natural Language Generation (NLG) components to produce human-readable text and may also utilize GUI elements like buttons, images, and other interactive components.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Rasa: A Framework for Building TOD Systems\n\nRasa (https://rasa.com/) is an open-source framework specifically designed for building TOD systems.  It offers a flexible and powerful platform for developing sophisticated conversational AI assistants.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n\nNLU is a crucial component of any conversational AI system.  It involves two primary tasks:\n\n* **Intent Classification:** This task aims to identify the user's intention or goal expressed in their message.  It is typically approached as a multi-label sentence classification problem. For example, the utterance \"What's the weather like tomorrow?\" might be classified with the intent `request_weather`.\n\n* **Entity Recognition:** This task involves identifying and extracting specific pieces of information (entities) from the user's message.  This can be achieved using Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques, which can be rule-based or machine learning-based.  In the example above, \"tomorrow\" would be recognized as a date entity.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Conversation Design\n\nEffective conversation design is essential for creating engaging and user-friendly chatbots.  The process involves:\n\n* **User Analysis:**  Understanding the target audience, their needs, and their communication style.\n* **Purpose Definition:** Clearly defining the assistant's purpose and the tasks it should be able to handle.\n* **Conversation Flow Mapping:** Documenting typical conversation flows and anticipating potential user interactions.\n\nIt is challenging to predict every possible user query.  Start with hypothetical conversations during initial development, then refine the system using real user interactions gathered during testing and deployment.  This iterative approach allows the bot to adapt to real-world usage patterns.",

Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.

            "### Building a Poetry Generator\n\n\n#### Leopardi Poetry Generator\n\nThis example uses a corpus of Giacomo Leopardi's poetry to train a character-level language model.  This means that the RNN will process the text one character at a time, learning the statistical relationships between characters in Leopardi's writing style.\n\n#### Extract the Training Samples\n\nThe corpus is divided into sequences of characters of a fixed length (maxlen). Each sequence serves as input to the RNN, and the next character in the corpus following the sequence is the target output.\n\n\n#### Build and Train the Model\n\nAn LSTM model is trained to predict the next character in the sequence.  The choice of LSTM is motivated by its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is relevant for modeling the complexities of poetic language.\n\n```python\n# Example (Illustrative - Requires further development)\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass PoetryGenerator(nn.Module):\n  # ... (Define LSTM model similar to SpamDetector, but for character-level input)\n\n# ... (Training loop and data preprocessing, similar to SpamDetector example)\n```\n\n#### Generate a new Poetry\n\nHelper functions sample from the model's predictions at each character step and concatenate the sampled characters to generate new text, starting from a seed character or sequence. The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated poetry, as explained earlier.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n### References\n\n* Natural Language Processing in Action: Understanding, Analyzing, and Generating Text with Python (Chapters 8 and 9)\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models: Enhanced\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 7: Dialog Engines**\n\n*Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco*\n\n*DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno*\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of dialogue engines, focusing on building task-oriented dialogue systems.

The document then introduces Rasa, a popular open-source framework for building these systems, covering its key components, installation, project structure, essential files, commands, API, and integration with web frontends.  Finally, it touches upon custom actions and provides valuable resources for further learning.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Dialogue System Types\n\nConversational AI systems can be broadly categorized into two main types:\n\n* **Chit-Chat Systems:** These systems are designed for open-ended conversations without a specific goal.  The primary focus is on generating human-like, engaging responses, and the success is often measured by the length and natural flow of the conversation.  Examples include casual conversation bots and entertainment-focused chatbots.\n\n* **Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems (TOD):**  TOD systems are designed to assist users in accomplishing specific tasks. They prioritize understanding user requests, tracking the conversation's context, and generating actions to fulfill the user's goal.  Efficiency is key, aiming to minimize the number of conversational turns needed to complete the task. Examples include booking flights, scheduling meetings, providing information, and controlling smart home devices.\n\n**Examples of Task-Oriented Dialogue:**\n\n* **Information Retrieval:** \"Which room is the dialogue tutorial in?\" or \"When is the IJCNLP 2017 conference?\"\n* **Task Completion:** \"Book me a flight from Seattle to Taipei.\" or \"Schedule a meeting with Bill at 10:00 tomorrow.\"\n* **Recommendation:** \"Can you suggest me a restaurant?\" or \"Can you suggest me something to see near me?\"",

It begins by explaining the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which motivated the development of Transformers.  Following this, the core components of the Transformer model are detailed, focusing on the mechanism of self-attention.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Limitations of RNNs**\n\nRNNs, while powerful for sequential data processing, face several inherent limitations that hinder their performance, especially with long sequences:\n\n* **Vanishing Gradients:** This problem arises during backpropagation through time (BPTT), the algorithm used to train RNNs.  As gradients are propagated back through the network, they can diminish exponentially, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The repeated multiplication of small derivative values during BPTT leads to the vanishing gradient, effectively preventing the network from adjusting its weights based on earlier parts of the sequence.\n\n* **Slow Training:** RNNs process data sequentially, meaning they handle one input at a time.  This inherent sequentiality prevents the network from leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, resulting in significantly slower training times, especially for long sequences.  The network must complete processing ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 before starting on ùë•ùëñ, creating a bottleneck.\n\n* **Limited Long-Term Memory:** RNNs struggle to retain information from earlier stages of the sequence when processing long sequences. Information from the beginning of a sequence is gradually lost as the network proceeds, making it difficult for the model to understand and utilize context over extended spans of text. This is typically represented by a context vector, which has a fixed size and thus cannot effectively store information from arbitrarily long sequences.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Transformer**\n\nIntroduced by Google Brain in 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by addressing the shortcomings of RNNs. It enables parallel processing of sequence elements, significantly speeding up training and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. The number of layers traversed is independent of the sequence length, contributing to its efficiency and ability to handle long-range dependencies. While initially designed for machine translation, its components are adaptable to various NLP tasks.",

Each token is then assigned a unique numerical identifier.\n* **Input Embedding:**  Tokens are represented as dense vectors in a continuous Euclidean space. This embedding captures semantic relationships between words, placing similar words closer together and dissimilar words further apart.\n* **Positional Encoding:**  Since the attention mechanism is order-agnostic, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings.  These encodings provide information about the position of each token in the sequence, enabling the model to understand word order.\n* **Encoder:** Processes the input sequence to generate an intermediate representation. It consists of multiple identical layers, each employing self-attention and a feed-forward network.\n* **Decoder:** Generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation.

            "### Encoder-only Transformer\n\nThe transformer architecture, originally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, consists of both encoder and decoder components.  However, certain tasks don't require the full architecture.\n\n* **Sequence-to-Sequence of the Same Length:**  When the input and output sequences have the same length, only the encoder is necessary.  The output vectors (ùëß‚ÇÅ, ..., ùëßùë°) are derived directly from the encoder, allowing for direct loss computation. Examples include part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition.\n\n* **Sequence to Single Value:**  For tasks like sequence classification, where the output is a single value, the encoder is sufficient.  A special `[CLS]` token is prepended to the input sequence, and its corresponding output vector (ùëß‚ÇÅ) represents the entire sequence, used for computing the loss function.  Sentiment analysis is a typical example of such a task.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Google in 2018, is a powerful language model leveraging the encoder part of the transformer architecture. It comes in different sizes, with BERT-base (12 encoder blocks, 110M parameters) and BERT-large (24 encoder blocks, 340M parameters) being the most common. BERT's key strength lies in its ability to understand bidirectional context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words to understand the meaning of a word within a sentence. This is a significant advancement over traditional unidirectional language models.  BERT is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT Input Encoding\n\nBERT employs the WordPiece tokenizer, a subword tokenization method, to process input text.\n\n* **Subword Tokenization:** WordPiece breaks words into smaller units (subwords), allowing BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words and efficiently represent a wide range of vocabulary with a smaller vocabulary size.  Common words are treated as single tokens, while rarer words are split into constituent subwords.\n\n* **Vocabulary:**  WordPiece constructs a vocabulary of common words and subwords. For instance, \"unhappiness\" could be tokenized into \"un,\" \"happy,\" and \"##ness,\" where \"##\" signifies a subword continuing a previous word.\n\n* **Special Tokens:** BERT utilizes specific tokens: `[CLS]` at the beginning of each sequence for classification tasks and `[SEP]` to separate sentences within a sequence or mark the end of a single sentence.\n\n* **Token IDs:**  Each token is converted into a numerical ID corresponding to its position in the BERT vocabulary, which serves as the input to the model.\n\n**Advantages of WordPiece Embedding:**\n\n* **Handles Unseen Words:**  Facilitates the representation of rare or unknown words by breaking them into known subwords.\n* **Reduced Vocabulary Size:** Improves computational efficiency compared to character-level models.\n* **Captures Morphology:**  Helps capture morphological information by representing words through their subword components.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT [CLS] Token\n\nThe `[CLS]` token, prepended to every input sequence, serves as an aggregate representation of the entire sequence.  After processing the input, BERT's final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context of the sequence. This embedding is used for downstream tasks like classification.\n\n* **Single-Sentence Classification:**  The `[CLS]` embedding is directly fed into a classifier for tasks like sentiment analysis.\n\n* **Sentence-Pair Tasks:**  For tasks involving two sentences (e.g., question answering, paraphrase detection), the `[CLS]` embedding represents the relationship between the two sentences.",
            "**Overview of Common NLP Models**\n\nThe original text lists several prominent NLP models:  Pythia, Dolly, GPT-3.5, OPT, BLOOM, GPT-Neo/X, FLAN, BART, T5, and BERT.  These models vary in size (parameter count), architecture, and intended use cases. The parameter count gives a general indication of the model's complexity and computational requirements.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Building Interactive Demos with Gradio**\n\nGradio simplifies the creation and hosting of interactive demos for machine learning models:\n\n* **Ease of Use:** Gradio provides a user-friendly interface for building demos quickly.\n* **Free Hosting:** hf.space offers free hosting for Gradio demos, making it easy to share your work.\n* **Installation:**  Install Gradio using `conda install gradio`.\n* **Further Information:** Refer to [https://bit.ly/34wESgd](https://bit.ly/34wESgd) for more details and examples.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Additional Context (Transformer Architecture and Training):**\n\nThe original text also included detailed information about the Transformer architecture, encompassing the encoder-decoder structure, attention mechanisms, and masking in the decoder.  It further discussed training transformers for translation tasks, including data preparation using the `datasets` library, tokenization with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), and fine-tuning pre-trained models using the `Trainer` class from the `transformers` library.  This contextual information is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the models available on the Hugging Face Hub and effectively utilizing them for various NLP tasks.  It also highlighted the importance of using established data structures and APIs for consistency and avoiding bugs.

            "### Practice on Token Classification and Named Entity Recognition\n\nThe provided Hugging Face tutorial (https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/2?fw=pt) offers practical guidance on using BERT for token classification and named entity recognition.  It recommends exploring different BERT versions, testing with custom prompts and public datasets like CoNLL-2003 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/eriktks/conll2003), and fine-tuning lightweight BERT versions when resources permit. This hands-on approach allows for practical experience with BERT's application in these crucial NLP tasks.  Experimenting with different models, datasets, and fine-tuning strategies will provide a deeper understanding of BERT's capabilities and limitations.  The Hugging Face ecosystem simplifies the process of leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 14: Decoder-only Transformers**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of decoder-only transformers, focusing on their architecture, applications, and prominent examples like GPT and LLaMA.  It explores the underlying mechanisms of text generation, training processes, and the advantages and limitations of these models.  Furthermore, it delves into specific details such as input encoding techniques and the evolution of different GPT versions, offering a comparative analysis between LLAMA and GPT.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Outline\n\n* Decoder-only transformer\n* GPT\n* LLAMA\n* Practice on text generation\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Decoder-only Transformer\n\nDecoder-only transformers, unlike the original transformer architecture which uses both encoder and decoder components, utilize only the decoder part. This architectural choice makes them particularly well-suited for autoregressive tasks, specifically text generation.  The absence of separate encoder layers simplifies the model and streamlines the process of generating text sequentially.  Tasks such as summarization and question answering, where the output is generated conditionally based on an input prompt, also benefit from this streamlined architecture.  Examples of successful decoder-only transformers include the GPT series and LLaMA.\n\nThe core principle behind text generation in decoder-only transformers is autoregression. This means generating text token by token, where each new token is predicted based on the preceding tokens in the sequence.  The input prompt and the generated text are treated as a single continuous sequence, enabling the model to implicitly \"encode\" the prompt's meaning while simultaneously \"decoding\" it into generated text. This unified approach eliminates the need for a separate encoder block.\n\nThe self-attention mechanism within decoder layers is crucial for context building.  However, a causal (unidirectional or forward) mask is applied to ensure that each token attends only to previous tokens, mimicking the natural flow of language generation.  This prevents the model from \"looking ahead\" at future tokens during training and generation.  This sequential processing allows the model to accumulate contextual information and learn complex relationships between tokens, effectively replacing the need for explicit encoder-decoder attention.",
            "**Project Overview:**\n\nThis exercise focuses on building a functional chatbot for a pizzeria using the Rasa framework. The chatbot should be capable of handling the following user interactions:\n\n* **Menu Request:** Users can request to see the pizzeria's menu.\n* **Pizza Order:** Users can select and order a single pizza from the available options on the menu.  Note that this version of the chatbot does not handle beverage orders.\n* **Order Confirmation and Logging:**  Upon confirmation of an order, the chatbot will record the order details, including the date, user ID, and the type of pizza ordered. This logging will be implemented using a custom Rasa action, providing a flexible way to integrate with various backend systems.\n* **Web-Based Interface:** The chatbot should have a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, improving usability and accessibility.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Development Hints:**\n\nThe following steps and tools are recommended for developing the chatbot:\n\n* **Rasa Initialization:**\n    * Create a project directory: `mkdir pizzaBot`\n    * Navigate to the directory: `cd pizzaBot`\n    * Initialize a Rasa project: `rasa init --no-prompt`.  The `--no-prompt` flag bypasses the interactive setup, streamlining the initialization process.\n\n* **Server Configuration and Execution:**\n    * Run the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled: `rasa run --cors \"*\"`. This allows the chatbot to be accessed from any web domain.\n    * Run the Rasa actions server: `rasa run actions`. This server handles custom actions, such as logging order details.\n\n* **Web Frontend Integration:** A pre-built web frontend is recommended for simplicity. The provided example utilizes a readily available widget:\n    *  `https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0` This widget simplifies the integration of the Rasa chatbot into a web page.\n\n* **Dummy Bot as Starting Point:** It is advisable to start with a basic, functional chatbot (a \"dummy bot\") and iteratively add features and complexity. This allows for easier debugging and incremental development.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Example Conversation:**\n\nThe following dialogue illustrates a potential interaction flow between the user and the chatbot:\n\n* **User:** can i have the menu?\n* **Bot:** What kind of pizza would you like? We have Margherita, Pepperoni, Vegetarian, and SO Mushroom.\n* **User:** Pepperoni\n* **Bot:** You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\n* **User:** yes\n* **Bot:** Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic flow of requesting the menu, ordering a pizza, and confirming the order. This provides a starting point for developing more complex dialogue flows.",
            "### Types of Fine-Tuning\n\nFine-tuning tailors a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on a dataset relevant to the target application.  This process allows the model to specialize its knowledge and improve its performance on the downstream task.\n\n**Why Fine-Tune?**\n\n* **Domain Specialization:**  Pre-trained LLMs possess broad knowledge but may lack expertise in specific areas. Fine-tuning allows them to acquire specialized knowledge relevant to a particular domain, such as medical, legal, or financial.\n* **Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance:** Fine-tuning improves the accuracy and relevance of LLM outputs for specific applications.  A model fine-tuned for medical diagnosis will generate more accurate and relevant responses to medical queries than a general-purpose model.\n* **Effective Utilization of Smaller Datasets:** Fine-tuning enables LLMs to achieve good performance even with smaller, focused datasets, which are often easier to curate than massive general-purpose datasets.\n\n**Full Fine-Tuning:**\n\nThis method involves updating all the parameters of the pre-trained LLM. While it can lead to high accuracy on the target task, it has significant drawbacks:\n\n* **Computational Cost:**  Updating all parameters requires substantial computational resources and training time, making it impractical for many users and applications.\n* **Overfitting Risk:** With small datasets, full fine-tuning can lead to overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n\n**Other Types of Fine-Tuning:**\n\nSeveral alternative fine-tuning strategies address the limitations of full fine-tuning by updating only a subset of the model's parameters:\n\n* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** This category encompasses techniques like LoRA, Adapters, and Prefix-Tuning, which offer a balance between performance and efficiency.\n* **Instruction Fine-Tuning:** This approach focuses on aligning the LLM with specific instructions or prompts, making it more responsive and adaptable to diverse user queries.\n* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):**  RLHF combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to train LLMs to generate outputs that align with human preferences and values.  This method is crucial for developing chatbots and other interactive AI applications.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\n\nPEFT methods significantly reduce the computational and storage burden associated with full fine-tuning by modifying only a small fraction of the model's parameters.  This makes fine-tuning large LLMs feasible for resource-constrained environments and applications requiring frequent model updates. Popular PEFT methods are implemented in libraries like Hugging Face Transformers and `peft`.\n\n**PEFT Techniques:**\n\n* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** LoRA injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer model, allowing efficient fine-tuning with minimal parameter updates.\n* **Adapters:** These small, task-specific modules are inserted within the Transformer layers, enabling fine-tuning without modifying the original model weights.  Adapters are particularly useful for multi-task learning, where a single model can be adapted to various tasks by switching between different adapter modules.\n* **Prefix Tuning:**  This method prepends a sequence of trainable prefix tokens to the input sequence, influencing the model's attention mechanism and guiding its output generation without altering the original weights."

The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Transformer‚Äôs Pipeline\n\nThe Transformer processes sequential data through a distinct pipeline. First, the encoder processes the entire input sequence, generating a set of contextualized representations.  Next, the decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time.  At each step, the decoder receives the encoder's output and the previously generated words.  This process repeats until an end-of-sequence token is generated, signaling the completion of the output sequence.\n\nThe linked resource ([https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/)) provides an interactive visualization of the Transformer architecture, which can further aid understanding.\n\n`",

The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Transformer‚Äôs Pipeline\n\nThe Transformer processes sequential data through a distinct pipeline. First, the encoder processes the entire input sequence, generating a set of contextualized representations.  Next, the decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time.  At each step, the decoder receives the encoder's output and the previously generated words.  This process repeats until an end-of-sequence token is generated, signaling the completion of the output sequence.\n\nThe linked resource ([https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/)) provides an interactive visualization of the Transformer architecture, which can further aid understanding.\n\n`",

It begins by explaining the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which motivated the development of Transformers.  Following this, the core components of the Transformer model are detailed, focusing on the mechanism of self-attention.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Limitations of RNNs**\n\nRNNs, while powerful for sequential data processing, face several inherent limitations that hinder their performance, especially with long sequences:\n\n* **Vanishing Gradients:** This problem arises during backpropagation through time (BPTT), the algorithm used to train RNNs.  As gradients are propagated back through the network, they can diminish exponentially, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The repeated multiplication of small derivative values during BPTT leads to the vanishing gradient, effectively preventing the network from adjusting its weights based on earlier parts of the sequence.\n\n* **Slow Training:** RNNs process data sequentially, meaning they handle one input at a time.  This inherent sequentiality prevents the network from leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, resulting in significantly slower training times, especially for long sequences.  The network must complete processing ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 before starting on ùë•ùëñ, creating a bottleneck.\n\n* **Limited Long-Term Memory:** RNNs struggle to retain information from earlier stages of the sequence when processing long sequences. Information from the beginning of a sequence is gradually lost as the network proceeds, making it difficult for the model to understand and utilize context over extended spans of text. This is typically represented by a context vector, which has a fixed size and thus cannot effectively store information from arbitrarily long sequences.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Transformer**\n\nIntroduced by Google Brain in 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by addressing the shortcomings of RNNs. It enables parallel processing of sequence elements, significantly speeding up training and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. The number of layers traversed is independent of the sequence length, contributing to its efficiency and ability to handle long-range dependencies. While initially designed for machine translation, its components are adaptable to various NLP tasks.",
            "### Encoder-only Transformer\n\nThe transformer architecture, originally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, consists of both encoder and decoder components.  However, certain tasks don't require the full architecture.\n\n* **Sequence-to-Sequence of the Same Length:**  When the input and output sequences have the same length, only the encoder is necessary.  The output vectors (ùëß‚ÇÅ, ..., ùëßùë°) are derived directly from the encoder, allowing for direct loss computation. Examples include part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition.\n\n* **Sequence to Single Value:**  For tasks like sequence classification, where the output is a single value, the encoder is sufficient.  A special `[CLS]` token is prepended to the input sequence, and its corresponding output vector (ùëß‚ÇÅ) represents the entire sequence, used for computing the loss function.  Sentiment analysis is a typical example of such a task.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Google in 2018, is a powerful language model leveraging the encoder part of the transformer architecture. It comes in different sizes, with BERT-base (12 encoder blocks, 110M parameters) and BERT-large (24 encoder blocks, 340M parameters) being the most common. BERT's key strength lies in its ability to understand bidirectional context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words to understand the meaning of a word within a sentence. This is a significant advancement over traditional unidirectional language models.  BERT is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT Input Encoding\n\nBERT employs the WordPiece tokenizer, a subword tokenization method, to process input text.\n\n* **Subword Tokenization:** WordPiece breaks words into smaller units (subwords), allowing BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words and efficiently represent a wide range of vocabulary with a smaller vocabulary size.  Common words are treated as single tokens, while rarer words are split into constituent subwords.\n\n* **Vocabulary:**  WordPiece constructs a vocabulary of common words and subwords. For instance, \"unhappiness\" could be tokenized into \"un,\" \"happy,\" and \"##ness,\" where \"##\" signifies a subword continuing a previous word.\n\n* **Special Tokens:** BERT utilizes specific tokens: `[CLS]` at the beginning of each sequence for classification tasks and `[SEP]` to separate sentences within a sequence or mark the end of a single sentence.\n\n* **Token IDs:**  Each token is converted into a numerical ID corresponding to its position in the BERT vocabulary, which serves as the input to the model.\n\n**Advantages of WordPiece Embedding:**\n\n* **Handles Unseen Words:**  Facilitates the representation of rare or unknown words by breaking them into known subwords.\n* **Reduced Vocabulary Size:** Improves computational efficiency compared to character-level models.\n* **Captures Morphology:**  Helps capture morphological information by representing words through their subword components.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### BERT [CLS] Token\n\nThe `[CLS]` token, prepended to every input sequence, serves as an aggregate representation of the entire sequence.  After processing the input, BERT's final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context of the sequence. This embedding is used for downstream tasks like classification.\n\n* **Single-Sentence Classification:**  The `[CLS]` embedding is directly fed into a classifier for tasks like sentiment analysis.\n\n* **Sentence-Pair Tasks:**  For tasks involving two sentences (e.g., question answering, paraphrase detection), the `[CLS]` embedding represents the relationship between the two sentences.",

            "### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\n\nGPT, developed by OpenAI, represents a prominent family of decoder-only transformers. These models are pre-trained on vast text datasets to learn the nuances of language and generate human-like text.  This pre-training enables them to perform various natural language tasks with remarkable proficiency, even without task-specific training.\n\n* **GPT-1 (2018):** The initial iteration of GPT, showcasing the potential of the decoder-only architecture. It had 117 million parameters, distributed across 12 decoder blocks with 768-dimensional embeddings and 12 attention heads per block.\n* **GPT-2 (2019):** A significantly larger model, with the XL version boasting 1.5 billion parameters. This version comprised 48 decoder blocks with 1600-dimensional embeddings and 25 attention heads per block, enabling it to generate more coherent and lengthy text.\n* **GPT-3 (2020):** A substantial leap in scale, with 175 billion parameters organized into 96 decoder blocks with 12,288-dimensional embeddings and 96 attention heads per block. GPT-3 demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, code generation, and even rudimentary reasoning tasks.\n* **GPT-4 (2023):** The latest iteration introduced multi-modal capabilities, processing both image and text inputs. It also showcased enhanced reasoning and broader general knowledge. Detailed architectural information is not publicly available.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### GPT Input Encoding\n\nGPT models employ Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization. BPE represents a subword tokenization technique that balances word-level and character-level representations. It breaks down words into smaller, meaningful sub-units (tokens) based on their frequency in the training data.  This approach allows for a more efficient representation of both common and infrequent words, handling out-of-vocabulary words gracefully by decomposing them into known subwords.  The vocabulary size varies depending on the GPT version, with GPT-2 utilizing around 50,000 tokens.\n\n\n**Key Advantages of BPE:**\n\n* **Handles morphology and new words effectively:** By breaking down complex words into subword units, BPE effectively handles morphological variations and adapts to new or unseen words.\n* **Reduced vocabulary size:** Compared to character-level tokenization, BPE results in a smaller vocabulary, making training more efficient.\n* **Robust out-of-vocabulary handling:**  BPE's ability to decompose unknown words into subwords or characters provides resilience against out-of-vocabulary scenarios.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### GPT Pre-training\n\nGPT models are pre-trained using a next-token prediction objective, also known as autoregressive language modeling.  This training strategy involves predicting the next word (or token) in a sequence, effectively learning contextual relationships and linguistic patterns. The prediction is sequential, proceeding from left to right.  The training process utilizes massive and diverse datasets derived from internet text, allowing the model to absorb a wide range of linguistic structures and topical information.  GPT-1 was trained on BookCorpus, while subsequent versions like GPT-2 and GPT-3 utilized larger datasets like WebText and a combination of sources including Common Crawl, Books, and Wikipedia.  Training involves minimizing cross-entropy loss using optimizers like Adam, incorporating techniques like learning rate schedules (warm-up and decay) and large batch sizes to enhance training stability and generalization."

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",
            "**Project Overview:**\n\nThis exercise focuses on building a functional chatbot for a pizzeria using the Rasa framework. The chatbot should be capable of handling the following user interactions:\n\n* **Menu Request:** Users can request to see the pizzeria's menu.\n* **Pizza Order:** Users can select and order a single pizza from the available options on the menu.  Note that this version of the chatbot does not handle beverage orders.\n* **Order Confirmation and Logging:**  Upon confirmation of an order, the chatbot will record the order details, including the date, user ID, and the type of pizza ordered. This logging will be implemented using a custom Rasa action, providing a flexible way to integrate with various backend systems.\n* **Web-Based Interface:** The chatbot should have a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, improving usability and accessibility.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Development Hints:**\n\nThe following steps and tools are recommended for developing the chatbot:\n\n* **Rasa Initialization:**\n    * Create a project directory: `mkdir pizzaBot`\n    * Navigate to the directory: `cd pizzaBot`\n    * Initialize a Rasa project: `rasa init --no-prompt`.  The `--no-prompt` flag bypasses the interactive setup, streamlining the initialization process.\n\n* **Server Configuration and Execution:**\n    * Run the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled: `rasa run --cors \"*\"`. This allows the chatbot to be accessed from any web domain.\n    * Run the Rasa actions server: `rasa run actions`. This server handles custom actions, such as logging order details.\n\n* **Web Frontend Integration:** A pre-built web frontend is recommended for simplicity. The provided example utilizes a readily available widget:\n    *  `https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0` This widget simplifies the integration of the Rasa chatbot into a web page.\n\n* **Dummy Bot as Starting Point:** It is advisable to start with a basic, functional chatbot (a \"dummy bot\") and iteratively add features and complexity. This allows for easier debugging and incremental development.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Example Conversation:**\n\nThe following dialogue illustrates a potential interaction flow between the user and the chatbot:\n\n* **User:** can i have the menu?\n* **Bot:** What kind of pizza would you like? We have Margherita, Pepperoni, Vegetarian, and SO Mushroom.\n* **User:** Pepperoni\n* **Bot:** You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\n* **User:** yes\n* **Bot:** Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic flow of requesting the menu, ordering a pizza, and confirming the order. This provides a starting point for developing more complex dialogue flows.",

The Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer (multilingual support) are common stemming algorithms available in NLTK.\n\n**Lemmatization:**\n\nLemmatization, a more sophisticated approach, uses dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine a word's canonical form (lemma), considering its part of speech.

Token Normalization: Cleaning and standardizing tokens.\n4. Stemming and Lemmatization:  Reducing words to their root forms.\n5. Part of Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical labels to tokens.\n6. Introducing spaCy:  An overview of a powerful NLP library in Python.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Tokenization\n\n**Preparing the Environment**\n\nJupyter notebooks (installable through `pip install jupyter` and the Jupyter extension for VS Code) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) are recommended for the exercises.  A virtual environment (`python -m venv .env` and `source .env/bin/activate`) is good practice for managing dependencies.  The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are required (`pip install numpy pandas`).\n\n**Text Segmentation**\n\nText segmentation divides text into meaningful units at different levels:\n\n* **Paragraph Segmentation:** Dividing a document into paragraphs.  This often relies on visual cues like line breaks or indentation.\n* **Sentence Segmentation:**  Splitting paragraphs into sentences. This typically uses punctuation like periods, question marks, and exclamation points.\n* **Word Segmentation:** Separating sentences into individual words.  This can be complex due to punctuation, contractions, and language-specific rules.\n\nTokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation, breaking text into units called tokens.\n\n**What is a Token?**\n\nA token is the smallest meaningful unit of text considered by an NLP system. Examples include:\n\n* **Words:** \"The,\" \"quick,\" \"brown,\" \"fox.\"\n* **Punctuation Marks:** \".\", \",\", \"!\", \"?\". These can be important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure.\n* **Emojis:** üòÄ, üò≠. These convey emotional information.\n* **Numbers:** \"123,\" \"3.14.\"  These can represent quantities or other numerical data.\n* **Sub-words:** \"pre-,\" \"re-,\" \"-ing,\" \"-ed.\"  These can help with handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological information.\n* **Phrases:** \"ice cream,\" \"New York.\"  These represent multi-word expressions that function as a single unit.\n\n**Tokenizer Implementation**\n\nWhile using whitespace as delimiters seems simple, it's inadequate for languages without clear word boundaries (e.g., Chinese).  Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.  A good tokenizer should correctly separate \"51\" and \".\" in a sentence like \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\"  We will explore more robust tokenization techniques later, including regular expressions and specialized tokenizers.",
            "### Bag of Words Representation\n\n**Turning Words into Numbers: One-hot Vectors**\n\nOne-hot encoding represents each word in a vocabulary as a vector. The vector's length equals the vocabulary size, and only the element corresponding to the word's index is 1; all others are 0.  While this preserves all information and allows document reconstruction, it creates very sparse, high-dimensional vectors.\n\n**Limitations of One-hot Vectors:**\n\nThe sparsity leads to massive memory requirements for large vocabularies and corpora.  For example, a vocabulary of one million words and a corpus of 3,000 short books (3,500 sentences per book, 15 words per sentence) would require around 17.9 TB of storage using one-hot vectors, making it impractical.\n\n**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**\n\nBoW addresses the sparsity issue by summing the one-hot vectors for all words in a document.  This results in a single vector where each element represents the count of a specific word in the document.  While BoW is more memory-efficient, it loses word order information, which can be crucial for understanding meaning.  A binary variant of BoW simply indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word, disregarding its frequency.\n\n**Binary BoW: Example**\n\nConsider the corpus:\n\n```python\nsentences = [\n    \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\",\n    \"Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.\",\n    \"In addition to being a painter, Leonardo da Vinci was also a skilled engineer.\",\n    \"Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle.\",\n    \"The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most prestigious events in tennis.\",\n    \"A tennis match is typically played as a best of three or best of five sets.\"\n]\n```\n\nBy generating a vocabulary and BoW vectors, we can observe the overlap in word usage between sentences.  This overlap, quantifiable using metrics like the dot product, allows us to compare documents and identify similarities.  BoW is foundational for document retrieval and search due to its efficiency and compatibility with hardware-accelerated binary operations.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Token Normalization\n\n**Improving Tokenization with Regular Expressions:**\n\nBeyond whitespace, characters like tabs (`\\t`), newlines (`\\n`), returns (`\\r`), and punctuation also act as delimiters.  Regular expressions provide more control over tokenization, allowing us to handle these characters.  However, more complex scenarios like abbreviations, numbers, and special symbols may require dedicated tokenizers.\n\n**Case Folding:**\n\nCase folding reduces vocabulary size by converting all text to lowercase.  While this improves matching and recall, it can conflate words with different meanings (e.g., \"US\" vs. \"us\").  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is needed to preserve meaningful capitalization for proper nouns.\n\n**Stop Words:**\n\nStop words are frequent words (e.g., \"the,\" \"a,\" \"is\") that often carry little semantic weight.  Removing them reduces noise and processing time, but can sometimes discard important contextual information (e.g., \"Mark reported to the CEO\" becomes \"Mark reported CEO,\" changing the meaning).\n\n**Combining Normalization Techniques:**\n\nCombining regular expressions, case folding, and stop word removal significantly enhances basic text preprocessing. Libraries like NLTK offer extended stop word lists and other advanced preprocessing tools."

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",
            "**Project Overview:**\n\nThis exercise focuses on building a functional chatbot for a pizzeria using the Rasa framework. The chatbot should be capable of handling the following user interactions:\n\n* **Menu Request:** Users can request to see the pizzeria's menu.\n* **Pizza Order:** Users can select and order a single pizza from the available options on the menu.  Note that this version of the chatbot does not handle beverage orders.\n* **Order Confirmation and Logging:**  Upon confirmation of an order, the chatbot will record the order details, including the date, user ID, and the type of pizza ordered. This logging will be implemented using a custom Rasa action, providing a flexible way to integrate with various backend systems.\n* **Web-Based Interface:** The chatbot should have a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, improving usability and accessibility.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Development Hints:**\n\nThe following steps and tools are recommended for developing the chatbot:\n\n* **Rasa Initialization:**\n    * Create a project directory: `mkdir pizzaBot`\n    * Navigate to the directory: `cd pizzaBot`\n    * Initialize a Rasa project: `rasa init --no-prompt`.  The `--no-prompt` flag bypasses the interactive setup, streamlining the initialization process.\n\n* **Server Configuration and Execution:**\n    * Run the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled: `rasa run --cors \"*\"`. This allows the chatbot to be accessed from any web domain.\n    * Run the Rasa actions server: `rasa run actions`. This server handles custom actions, such as logging order details.\n\n* **Web Frontend Integration:** A pre-built web frontend is recommended for simplicity. The provided example utilizes a readily available widget:\n    *  `https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0` This widget simplifies the integration of the Rasa chatbot into a web page.\n\n* **Dummy Bot as Starting Point:** It is advisable to start with a basic, functional chatbot (a \"dummy bot\") and iteratively add features and complexity. This allows for easier debugging and incremental development.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Example Conversation:**\n\nThe following dialogue illustrates a potential interaction flow between the user and the chatbot:\n\n* **User:** can i have the menu?\n* **Bot:** What kind of pizza would you like? We have Margherita, Pepperoni, Vegetarian, and SO Mushroom.\n* **User:** Pepperoni\n* **Bot:** You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\n* **User:** yes\n* **Bot:** Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic flow of requesting the menu, ordering a pizza, and confirming the order.

Token Normalization: Cleaning and standardizing tokens.\n4. Stemming and Lemmatization:  Reducing words to their root forms.\n5. Part of Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical labels to tokens.\n6. Introducing spaCy:  An overview of a powerful NLP library in Python.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Tokenization\n\n**Preparing the Environment**\n\nJupyter notebooks (installable through `pip install jupyter` and the Jupyter extension for VS Code) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) are recommended for the exercises.  A virtual environment (`python -m venv .env` and `source .env/bin/activate`) is good practice for managing dependencies.  The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are required (`pip install numpy pandas`).\n\n**Text Segmentation**\n\nText segmentation divides text into meaningful units at different levels:\n\n* **Paragraph Segmentation:** Dividing a document into paragraphs.  This often relies on visual cues like line breaks or indentation.\n* **Sentence Segmentation:**  Splitting paragraphs into sentences. This typically uses punctuation like periods, question marks, and exclamation points.\n* **Word Segmentation:** Separating sentences into individual words.  This can be complex due to punctuation, contractions, and language-specific rules.\n\nTokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation, breaking text into units called tokens.\n\n**What is a Token?**\n\nA token is the smallest meaningful unit of text considered by an NLP system. Examples include:\n\n* **Words:** \"The,\" \"quick,\" \"brown,\" \"fox.\"\n* **Punctuation Marks:** \".\", \",\", \"!\", \"?\". These can be important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure.\n* **Emojis:** üòÄ, üò≠. These convey emotional information.\n* **Numbers:** \"123,\" \"3.14.\"  These can represent quantities or other numerical data.\n* **Sub-words:** \"pre-,\" \"re-,\" \"-ing,\" \"-ed.\"  These can help with handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological information.\n* **Phrases:** \"ice cream,\" \"New York.\"  These represent multi-word expressions that function as a single unit.\n\n**Tokenizer Implementation**\n\nWhile using whitespace as delimiters seems simple, it's inadequate for languages without clear word boundaries (e.g., Chinese).  Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.  A good tokenizer should correctly separate \"51\" and \".\" in a sentence like \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\"  We will explore more robust tokenization techniques later, including regular expressions and specialized tokenizers.",
            "### Bag of Words Representation\n\n**Turning Words into Numbers: One-hot Vectors**\n\nOne-hot encoding represents each word in a vocabulary as a vector. The vector's length equals the vocabulary size, and only the element corresponding to the word's index is 1; all others are 0.  While this preserves all information and allows document reconstruction, it creates very sparse, high-dimensional vectors.\n\n**Limitations of One-hot Vectors:**\n\nThe sparsity leads to massive memory requirements for large vocabularies and corpora.  For example, a vocabulary of one million words and a corpus of 3,000 short books (3,500 sentences per book, 15 words per sentence) would require around 17.9 TB of storage using one-hot vectors, making it impractical.\n\n**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**\n\nBoW addresses the sparsity issue by summing the one-hot vectors for all words in a document.  This results in a single vector where each element represents the count of a specific word in the document.  While BoW is more memory-efficient, it loses word order information, which can be crucial for understanding meaning.  A binary variant of BoW simply indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word, disregarding its frequency.\n\n**Binary BoW: Example**\n\nConsider the corpus:\n\n```python\nsentences = [\n    \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\",\n    \"Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.\",\n    \"In addition to being a painter, Leonardo da Vinci was also a skilled engineer.\",\n    \"Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle.\",\n    \"The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most prestigious events in tennis.\",\n    \"A tennis match is typically played as a best of three or best of five sets.\"\n]\n```\n\nBy generating a vocabulary and BoW vectors, we can observe the overlap in word usage between sentences.  This overlap, quantifiable using metrics like the dot product, allows us to compare documents and identify similarities.  BoW is foundational for document retrieval and search due to its efficiency and compatibility with hardware-accelerated binary operations.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Token Normalization\n\n**Improving Tokenization with Regular Expressions:**\n\nBeyond whitespace, characters like tabs (`\\t`), newlines (`\\n`), returns (`\\r`), and punctuation also act as delimiters.  Regular expressions provide more control over tokenization, allowing us to handle these characters.  However, more complex scenarios like abbreviations, numbers, and special symbols may require dedicated tokenizers.\n\n**Case Folding:**\n\nCase folding reduces vocabulary size by converting all text to lowercase.  While this improves matching and recall, it can conflate words with different meanings (e.g., \"US\" vs. \"us\").  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is needed to preserve meaningful capitalization for proper nouns.\n\n**Stop Words:**\n\nStop words are frequent words (e.g., \"the,\" \"a,\" \"is\") that often carry little semantic weight.  Removing them reduces noise and processing time, but can sometimes discard important contextual information (e.g., \"Mark reported to the CEO\" becomes \"Mark reported CEO,\" changing the meaning).\n\n**Combining Normalization Techniques:**\n\nCombining regular expressions, case folding, and stop word removal significantly enhances basic text preprocessing. Libraries like NLTK offer extended stop word lists and other advanced preprocessing tools."

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",
            "**Project Overview:**\n\nThis exercise focuses on building a functional chatbot for a pizzeria using the Rasa framework. The chatbot should be capable of handling the following user interactions:\n\n* **Menu Request:** Users can request to see the pizzeria's menu.\n* **Pizza Order:** Users can select and order a single pizza from the available options on the menu.  Note that this version of the chatbot does not handle beverage orders.\n* **Order Confirmation and Logging:**  Upon confirmation of an order, the chatbot will record the order details, including the date, user ID, and the type of pizza ordered. This logging will be implemented using a custom Rasa action, providing a flexible way to integrate with various backend systems.\n* **Web-Based Interface:** The chatbot should have a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, improving usability and accessibility.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Development Hints:**\n\nThe following steps and tools are recommended for developing the chatbot:\n\n* **Rasa Initialization:**\n    * Create a project directory: `mkdir pizzaBot`\n    * Navigate to the directory: `cd pizzaBot`\n    * Initialize a Rasa project: `rasa init --no-prompt`.  The `--no-prompt` flag bypasses the interactive setup, streamlining the initialization process.\n\n* **Server Configuration and Execution:**\n    * Run the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled: `rasa run --cors \"*\"`. This allows the chatbot to be accessed from any web domain.\n    * Run the Rasa actions server: `rasa run actions`. This server handles custom actions, such as logging order details.\n\n* **Web Frontend Integration:** A pre-built web frontend is recommended for simplicity. The provided example utilizes a readily available widget:\n    *  `https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0` This widget simplifies the integration of the Rasa chatbot into a web page.\n\n* **Dummy Bot as Starting Point:** It is advisable to start with a basic, functional chatbot (a \"dummy bot\") and iteratively add features and complexity. This allows for easier debugging and incremental development.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Example Conversation:**\n\nThe following dialogue illustrates a potential interaction flow between the user and the chatbot:\n\n* **User:** can i have the menu?\n* **Bot:** What kind of pizza would you like? We have Margherita, Pepperoni, Vegetarian, and SO Mushroom.\n* **User:** Pepperoni\n* **Bot:** You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\n* **User:** yes\n* **Bot:** Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic flow of requesting the menu, ordering a pizza, and confirming the order. This provides a starting point for developing more complex dialogue flows.",
            "### Stemming and Lemmatization\n\n**Stemming:**\n\nStemming reduces words to their root form (stem) by heuristically removing prefixes and suffixes.  While efficient, it can produce non-words (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"runn\").  The Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer (multilingual support) are common stemming algorithms available in NLTK.\n\n**Lemmatization:**\n\nLemmatization, a more sophisticated approach, uses dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine a word's canonical form (lemma), considering its part of speech.  This always results in a valid word (e.g., \"better\" becomes \"good\"). Lemmatization is generally more accurate but computationally slower than stemming.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Part of Speech (PoS) Tagging\n\nPoS tagging assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to tokens, providing valuable information about sentence structure and word function.  This is crucial for tasks like lemmatization, parsing, and named entity recognition.  PoS tagging is inherently ambiguous due to words having multiple possible tags depending on context.

It helps the model understand the relationships between words within the same sentence. For example, in the sentence \"The animal didn‚Äôt cross the street because it was too wide,\" self-attention helps the model associate \"it\" with \"the street\" rather than \"the animal.\" The attention mechanism employs three matrices: Query, Key, and Value. These matrices are derived from the input embeddings through linear transformations. The attention weights are calculated using scaled dot-product attention, which measures the similarity between query and key vectors. These weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the input sequence.

They're built using vast datasets and immense computational resources.\n\nThe Transformer architecture is key to their success, offering advantages like self-attention, which helps capture long-range dependencies in text, and scalability, allowing them to be trained on massive datasets. Byte Pair Encoding, or BPE, is also important for handling large vocabularies efficiently.\n\nLarge language models are pre-trained using self-supervised learning on massive text datasets. This can involve autoencoding models like BERT, autoregressive models like GPT, or seq2seq models. After pre-training, they can be adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning or prompting.\n\nMeta has developed a family of transformer-based language models called LLaMA, which come in different sizes to suit various computational needs. These models use Byte-Pair Encoding for tokenization and are pre-trained on datasets like \"The Pile.\"",

            "**Testing Metrics**\n\nEvaluating classifier performance requires appropriate metrics.  For multi-class and multi-label problems, several averaging methods are used:\n\n* **Micro Average:**  Calculates metrics globally by considering the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives across all classes. This approach is sensitive to class imbalance.\n* **Macro Average:** Computes the metric for each class independently and then averages the results. This treats all classes equally, regardless of their size.\n* **Weighted Average:**  Averages the metric for each class, weighted by the number of true instances (support) for each class. This balances the influence of different class sizes.\n* **Samples Average:** Calculates metrics at the instance level, averaging the performance across individual samples. This is particularly relevant for multi-label classification where each instance can have multiple labels.\n\n**Testing Results (Code Example and Output Included in Original Submission)**\n\nThis section presents the results of the classifier evaluation, including the chosen metrics.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n**Sentiment Analysis Exercise**\n\nSentiment analysis, a specific application of text classification, aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in text (positive, negative, or neutral). Its applications are wide-ranging, including:\n\n* **Business:** Understanding customer feedback and brand perception.\n* **Finance:**  Gauging market sentiment and predicting stock movements.\n* **Politics:** Analyzing public opinion and political discourse.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**IMDB Dataset**\n\nThe IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks.  Its balanced class distribution simplifies evaluation.

            "### Intro to Text Generation\n\n#### Generative Models\n\nGenerative models are a class of machine learning models designed to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new data points that resemble the training data. Unlike discriminative models, which are used for classification or regression tasks, generative models are concerned with creating original data.  RNNs and Transformers are prominent examples of generative models used in NLP.\n\n\n#### Applications\n\nText generation has a wide range of applications in various fields:\n\n* **Machine Translation:**  Generating text in a target language given text in a source language.\n* **Question Answering:** Generating answers to given questions.\n* **Automatic Summarization:**  Generating concise summaries of longer texts.\n* **Text Completion:**  Predicting the next words in a given text prompt.\n* **Dialogue Systems:** Generating responses in a conversational setting.\n* **Creative Writing:**  Generating poems, scripts, stories, and other forms of creative text.\n\n\n\n#### Language Model\n\nA language model (LM) assigns probabilities to sequences of words. It predicts the probability of the next word in a sequence given the preceding words.  This allows the model to capture the statistical structure of language, learning the likelihood of different word combinations. New text sequences are generated by sampling from this probability distribution, starting with a seed text and iteratively adding predicted tokens.\n\n\n#### LM Training\n\nAn RNN-based language model is trained by feeding it sequences of tokens. At each time step, the RNN receives a token and predicts the next one in the sequence. The prediction is compared with the actual next token in the training data, and the error is backpropagated to update the network‚Äôs weights.  This process is repeated for each token in each sequence in the training corpus.\n\n\n\n#### Sampling\n\nGenerative models employ sampling techniques to introduce randomness and diversity into the generated text.  Instead of always selecting the word with the highest predicted probability, the model samples from the probability distribution, allowing for less likely but potentially more creative or interesting word choices.\n\n\n\n#### Temperature\n\nTemperature (T) is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the sampling process.  It modifies the probability distribution before sampling:\n\n`q_i = exp(log(p_i) / T) / sum(exp(log(p_j) / T))`\n\nwhere `p_i` is the original probability of the i-th word and `q_i` is the modified probability after applying the temperature.\n\n* **Lower Temperatures (T < 1):** Make the model more deterministic, favoring words with higher probabilities. This results in more predictable and less diverse text.\n* **Higher Temperatures (T > 1):** Increase randomness and surprise, allowing the model to sample less likely words. This leads to more creative and diverse but potentially less coherent text.",
            "### Key Rasa Files and Commands (Detailed)\n\n\n**`domain.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\nintents:\n- greet\n- goodbye\n- ...\n\nresponses:\n  utter_greet:\n  - text: \"Hey! How are you?\"\n  utter_goodbye:\n  - text: \"Bye\"\n  ...\n\nsession_config:\n  session_expiration_time: 60  # minutes\n  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true\n```\n\nThe `session_config` section manages conversation sessions. `session_expiration_time` defines the inactivity duration before a session expires. `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines if slot values are preserved across sessions.  This is useful for maintaining context if a user returns after a short break.\n\n**`nlu.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- intent: greet\n  examples: |\n    - hey\n    - hello\n    - hi\n    - ...\n```\n\nRasa requires a sufficient number of examples (7-10 minimum) per intent to effectively train the NLU model to recognize and classify user intentions.  These examples should cover variations in phrasing and vocabulary.\n\n**`stories.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- story: happy path\n  steps:\n  - intent: greet\n  - action: utter_greet\n  - intent: mood_great\n  - action: utter_happy\n```\n\nStories define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions. They serve as training data for the dialogue management model to learn appropriate responses in different conversational contexts.\n\n**`rules.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- rule: Say goodbye anytime the user says goodbye\n  steps:\n  - intent: goodbye\n  - action: utter_goodbye\n```\n\nRules specify simple, deterministic dialogue flows. Unlike stories, rules are not used for training a machine learning model; they are applied directly as hard-coded logic.\n\n\n**Visualizing Stories:**  Use `rasa visualize` to generate a graphical representation of the conversation flows defined in your stories. This helps in understanding and debugging the dialogue flow.\n\n\n**Rasa Commands:**\n\n* `rasa train`: Trains the NLU and dialogue management models using the data in the `data` directory and the configuration in `config.yml`.  The trained models are saved in the `models` directory.\n\n* `rasa shell`: Starts an interactive shell where you can test the trained chatbot by typing messages.  This allows you to interact with the bot and evaluate its responses in a controlled environment.\n\n* `rasa run`: Starts a server to deploy the chatbot, making it accessible via HTTP.  The `--cors \"*\" ` option enables cross-origin requests, allowing interaction from web applications hosted on different domains.\n\n* `rasa -h`: Displays help information and lists all available commands.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Rasa REST API\n\nRasa offers a REST API for integrating the chatbot with external systems.  This enables communication between your chatbot and web applications, mobile apps, or other services.\n\n* **REST Channel Configuration:** Add the REST channel to your `credentials.yml` file to enable the REST endpoint.  Restart the Rasa server for the changes to take effect.\n\n* **REST Endpoint:**  The bot becomes accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook` after configuring and restarting the server.  Refer to the official Rasa documentation for details: https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/connectors/your-own-website/\n\n* **Request and Response Format (Example):**\n\n    **Request (JSON):**\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"sender\": \"test_user\",\n      \"message\": \"I'm sad!\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Response (JSON):**\n\n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"recipient_id\": \"test_user\",\n        \"text\": \"Here is something to cheer you up:\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"recipient_id\": \"test_user\",\n        \"image\": \"https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"recipient_id\": \"test_user\",\n        \"text\": \"Did that help you?\"\n      }\n    ]\n    ```",

The enhanced version focuses on the core concepts of RAG and LangChain, providing concise explanations and relevant code examples.  For a complete understanding of the topics discussed, referring to the original book is recommended.  This separation allows the lesson notes to serve as a focused introduction and guide, while the book provides in-depth knowledge and broader context.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 21: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a crucial technique for refining Large Language Models (LLMs).  It explores the core concepts, workflow, benefits, drawbacks, and applications of RLHF, along with practical implementation guidance using the Transformers TRL library.

For multi-class and multi-label problems, several averaging methods are used:\n\n* **Micro Average:**  Calculates metrics globally by considering the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives across all classes. This approach is sensitive to class imbalance.\n* **Macro Average:** Computes the metric for each class independently and then averages the results. This treats all classes equally, regardless of their size.\n* **Weighted Average:**  Averages the metric for each class, weighted by the number of true instances (support) for each class. This balances the influence of different class sizes.\n* **Samples Average:** Calculates metrics at the instance level, averaging the performance across individual samples.

            "### Key Rasa Files and Commands (Detailed)\n\n\n**`domain.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\nintents:\n- greet\n- goodbye\n- ...\n\nresponses:\n  utter_greet:\n  - text: \"Hey! How are you?\"\n  utter_goodbye:\n  - text: \"Bye\"\n  ...\n\nsession_config:\n  session_expiration_time: 60  # minutes\n  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true\n```\n\nThe `session_config` section manages conversation sessions. `session_expiration_time` defines the inactivity duration before a session expires. `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines if slot values are preserved across sessions.  This is useful for maintaining context if a user returns after a short break.\n\n**`nlu.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- intent: greet\n  examples: |\n    - hey\n    - hello\n    - hi\n    - ...\n```\n\nRasa requires a sufficient number of examples (7-10 minimum) per intent to effectively train the NLU model to recognize and classify user intentions.  These examples should cover variations in phrasing and vocabulary.\n\n**`stories.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- story: happy path\n  steps:\n  - intent: greet\n  - action: utter_greet\n  - intent: mood_great\n  - action: utter_happy\n```\n\nStories define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions. They serve as training data for the dialogue management model to learn appropriate responses in different conversational contexts.\n\n**`rules.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- rule: Say goodbye anytime the user says goodbye\n  steps:\n  - intent: goodbye\n  - action: utter_goodbye\n```\n\nRules specify simple, deterministic dialogue flows. Unlike stories, rules are not used for training a machine learning model; they are applied directly as hard-coded logic.\n\n\n**Visualizing Stories:**  Use `rasa visualize` to generate a graphical representation of the conversation flows defined in your stories. This helps in understanding and debugging the dialogue flow.\n\n\n**Rasa Commands:**\n\n* `rasa train`: Trains the NLU and dialogue management models using the data in the `data` directory and the configuration in `config.yml`.  The trained models are saved in the `models` directory.\n\n* `rasa shell`: Starts an interactive shell where you can test the trained chatbot by typing messages.  This allows you to interact with the bot and evaluate its responses in a controlled environment.\n\n* `rasa run`: Starts a server to deploy the chatbot, making it accessible via HTTP.  The `--cors \"*\" ` option enables cross-origin requests, allowing interaction from web applications hosted on different domains.\n\n* `rasa -h`: Displays help information and lists all available commands.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Rasa REST API\n\nRasa offers a REST API for integrating the chatbot with external systems.  This enables communication between your chatbot and web applications, mobile apps, or other services.\n\n* **REST Channel Configuration:** Add the REST channel to your `credentials.yml` file to enable the REST endpoint.  Restart the Rasa server for the changes to take effect.\n\n* **REST Endpoint:**  The bot becomes accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook` after configuring and restarting the server.

            "**Tasks to enhance with RLHF**\n\nRLHF can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including:\n\n* **Text Generation:** Improve the quality, creativity, and relevance of generated text.\n* **Dialogue Systems:** Enhance the naturalness, engagement, and helpfulness of conversational agents.\n* **Language Translation:** Increase translation accuracy and fluency, capturing nuances and stylistic preferences.\n* **Summarization:**  Generate more concise, informative, and insightful summaries.\n* **Question Answering:** Improve the accuracy and completeness of answers, addressing complex questions more effectively.\n* **Sentiment Analysis:** Tailor sentiment identification to specific domains or business needs, accounting for subtle variations in expression.\n* **Computer Programming:**  Assist in software development by generating code snippets, completing code, and suggesting improvements, based on natural language descriptions of desired functionality.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Case study: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4**\n\nOpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exemplify the successful application of RLHF. OpenAI reports that RLHF has led to:\n\n* **Enhanced alignment:** Better adherence to user instructions and expectations.\n* **Fewer unsafe outputs:**  Reduced generation of toxic, biased, or harmful content.\n* **More human-like interactions:**  Improved naturalness and engagement in conversational contexts.\n\nThese models, widely used in applications like ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical benefits of RLHF in real-world scenarios.  The ongoing iterative improvement of these models with additional human feedback underscores the importance of continuous refinement in RLHF.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n### Transformers TRL library\n\n**TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)**\n\nTRL is a comprehensive library designed specifically for training Transformer language models using reinforcement learning.  It provides a full suite of tools for implementing the key stages of RLHF, from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reward model training (RM) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

            "### BERT Fine-tuning\n\nAfter pre-training, BERT is fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks by adding task-specific layers on top of the encoder output.  The pre-trained weights can be either frozen or further updated during fine-tuning. The process involves minimizing the cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual labels for the given task.  Fine-tuning allows adapting BERT's general language understanding to specific application domains.  The `[CLS]` token's representation is crucial during fine-tuning as it gets specifically trained to capture the nuances required for the target task.\n\n\n**Example Tasks:**\n\n* **Text Classification:** Sentiment analysis, topic categorization, spam detection.\n* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities like persons, organizations, and locations within text.\n* **Question Answering:**  Extractive question answering, where the model identifies the answer span within a given text passage.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n### BERT Strengths and Limitations\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Bidirectional Contextual Understanding:**  Captures rich contextual information from both left and right, significantly improving language understanding.\n* **Transfer Learning:**  Pre-training on large datasets allows for effective transfer learning to various downstream tasks, reducing the need for extensive task-specific data.\n* **State-of-the-art Performance:**  Achieves excellent results on various NLP benchmarks.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* **Computational Resources:** Requires substantial computational resources for pre-training and fine-tuning, especially for larger models.\n* **Memory Requirements:**  Large model size can pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n* **Data Dependency:**  While transfer learning reduces data requirements, fine-tuning still needs labeled data, which can be expensive to acquire.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Popular BERT Variants\n\nSeveral BERT variants have been developed to address its limitations and improve performance:\n\n* **RoBERTa:** Improved training methodology, larger datasets, removal of NSP task.\n* **ALBERT:** Parameter reduction techniques for efficiency.\n* **DistilBERT:** Knowledge distillation for smaller model size and faster inference.\n* **TinyBERT:**  Even smaller and faster than DistilBERT, optimized for resource-constrained environments.\n* **ELECTRA:**  More efficient pre-training using a replaced token detection task.\n* **Domain-Specific Variants:** SciBERT (scientific text), BioBERT (biomedical text), ClinicalBERT (clinical notes).\n* **Multilingual BERT (mBERT):** Supports multiple languages.\n* **Other Language-Specific Variants:** CamemBERT (French), FinBERT (financial), LegalBERT (legal).\n\nBERT's influence extends beyond NLP, inspiring transformer-based models in computer vision, such as Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, and Masked Auto Encoders (MAE).\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Practice on Token Classification and Named Entity Recognition\n\nThe provided Hugging Face tutorial (https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/2?fw=pt) offers practical guidance on using BERT for token classification and named entity recognition.  It recommends exploring different BERT versions, testing with custom prompts and public datasets like CoNLL-2003 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/eriktks/conll2003), and fine-tuning lightweight BERT versions when resources permit. This hands-on approach allows for practical experience with BERT's application in these crucial NLP tasks.

We will explore the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, the Encoder and Decoder structures, Masked Multi-Head Attention, Encoder-Decoder Attention, and the overall pipeline of the Transformer. This understanding is crucial for comprehending how Transformers process sequential data and achieve state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks.\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Outline\n\n* Multi-Head Attention\n* Encoder Output\n* Decoder\n* Masked Multi-Head Attention\n* Encoder-Decoder Attention\n* Output\n* Transformer‚Äôs Pipeline\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Multi-head Attention\n\nSelf-attention allows a model to consider the relationships between different words in a sequence when processing each word. However, a single attention mechanism might not capture all the nuances of these relationships. Multi-head attention addresses this limitation by employing multiple \"heads,\" each with its own set of learned weight matrices.  This allows the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously.\n\nEach head performs a scaled dot-product attention operation. The results from these parallel computations are then concatenated and transformed through another linear layer. This final transformation combines the various perspectives offered by the different heads into a unified representation.  Multi-head attention allows the model to capture a richer understanding of the relationships within the sequence compared to a single-head approach.\n\nJust like in single-head attention, Multi-Head Attention incorporates Add & Norm (skip connections and layer normalization) and Feed Forward layers. The Add & Norm component normalizes the output, stabilizing training and providing a regularization effect, while the residual connections (Add) help mitigate vanishing gradients, which is crucial for training deep networks. The Feed Forward layers introduce non-linear transformations, enabling the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships between words in the sequence.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Transformer‚Äôs Encoder\n\nThe Transformer‚Äôs Encoder processes the input sequence to generate a contextualized representation for each word.  Crucially, because self-attention mechanisms don't inherently account for word order, the encoder incorporates positional encoding. This is typically achieved by adding sinusoidal functions to the input embeddings, providing information about the position of each word in the sequence.\n\nEach encoder block consists of a multi-head self-attention layer followed by the Add & Norm and Feed Forward layers as described previously. This architecture allows the encoder to process each word in the context of all other words in the input sequence, including itself.\n\nThe encoder's design, where each block maintains the same output dimensionality as the input, allows for stacking multiple encoder blocks. The output of one block becomes the input to the next, enabling the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input sequence.\n\n\n`",
            "**Additional Context and Insights**\n\nThe core innovation of the Transformer model lies in its use of self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to consider the relationships between all words in a sequence simultaneously. This contrasts with RNNs, which process sequences sequentially. The parallel processing capabilities of transformers, coupled with their ability to handle long-range dependencies, have made them a cornerstone of modern NLP.\n\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE), a subword tokenization technique, is often used with transformers to handle large vocabularies efficiently. BPE allows the model to represent rare or unseen words as combinations of more frequent subword units.\n\nTransformers are highly scalable, meaning their capacity can be increased by stacking more layers and using larger datasets.  This scalability, combined with the parallelizability of attention, has enabled the development of extremely large language models (LLMs) capable of performing complex tasks like question answering, text generation, and translation.\n\n\nThe omission of recurrence in Transformers necessitates positional encodings to incorporate word order information. These encodings are crucial for tasks where word order is essential, like translation and grammar parsing.\n\nThe combination of BPE, self-attention, and positional encoding allows Transformers to effectively handle long sequences and capture complex relationships between words, leading to significant advancements in NLP.  These models can learn rich representations of text, enabling them to outperform traditional methods on various tasks. The attention mechanism is a key component of this success, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating the output.\n\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 1: NLP Overview**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nThis lesson provides a comprehensive overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a crucial field within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that bridges the gap between human language and computer understanding.

At each step, the decoder considers the encoder's output and the previously generated words in the output sequence.\n\nThe decoder block structure mirrors the encoder block, with the addition of a second multi-head attention mechanism, called encoder-decoder attention. This mechanism allows the decoder to attend to the relevant parts of the encoder's output when generating each word in the output sequence.\n\nThe original Transformer architecture used 6 decoder blocks. A key difference from the encoder's self-attention is the \"masked\" self-attention within the decoder. This mask prevents the decoder from attending to future positions in the output sequence during training, ensuring that predictions are made only based on the information available up to the current time step.\n\nThe final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function.  This projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, producing a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Masked Multi-Head Attention\n\nMasked Multi-Head Attention is crucial for training the decoder. During the generation of the *i*-th output word, the decoder should only consider the preceding words (positions 1 to *i-1*) and not \"peek\" into the future.  This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention scores, effectively setting the scores corresponding to future positions to negative infinity. This forces the softmax function to assign zero probability to these future positions.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Encoder-Decoder Attention\n\nEncoder-Decoder Attention bridges the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to leverage the contextualized information encoded by the encoder. In this mechanism, the queries come from the decoder, while the keys and values are derived from the encoder's output.  This allows the decoder to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the output sequence.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Output\n\nThe final decoder output for each time step is a vector representing the generated word. This vector is fed through a linear layer, which is often tied (shared weights) with the input embedding matrix, and a softmax function to compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary.  The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.\n\n\n`<----------section---------->`\n\n### Transformer‚Äôs Pipeline\n\nThe Transformer processes sequential data through a distinct pipeline. First, the encoder processes the entire input sequence, generating a set of contextualized representations.  Next, the decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time.  At each step, the decoder receives the encoder's output and the previously generated words.  This process repeats until an end-of-sequence token is generated, signaling the completion of the output sequence.\n\nThe linked resource ([https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/)) provides an interactive visualization of the Transformer architecture, which can further aid understanding.\n\n`",
            "`\n\n### Additional Context and Insights (Integrating Provided Context)\n\n\nThe Transformer architecture offers several advantages over traditional recurrent and convolutional models for sequence-to-sequence tasks. Key innovations include:\n\n* **Self-Attention:**  This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each word, capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than recurrent networks, which struggle with vanishing gradients over long sequences.\n\n* **Scalability:** The lack of recurrence and the parallelizable nature of attention computations allow Transformers to be scaled to much larger datasets and model sizes than RNNs or CNNs. This scalability has been instrumental in the development of large language models.\n\n* **Stackability:** The consistent input and output dimensions of Transformer layers facilitate stacking multiple layers, enabling the model to learn increasingly complex representations of the input data.\n\n* **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE):** While not part of the core Transformer architecture, BPE plays a critical role in handling large vocabularies efficiently by representing words as subword units.  This helps reduce the vocabulary size and addresses the out-of-vocabulary problem.\n\n* **Positional Encodings:**  These encodings compensate for the lack of inherent positional information in self-attention, allowing the model to account for word order in the input sequence.\n\nThese innovations, combined with the ability to train on massive datasets, have led to significant performance improvements in various NLP tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and text generation. The Transformer‚Äôs ability to capture long-range dependencies and be trained efficiently has been particularly crucial for the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) which demonstrate impressive abilities in understanding and generating human-like text.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 11: From Transformers to LLMs**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the transformative role of the Transformer architecture.  It covers the core concepts, training methodologies, datasets used, and various applications of LLMs.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Outline\n\n* Transformers for text representation and generation\n* Paradigm Shift in NLP\n* Pre-training of LLMs\n* Datasets and data pre-processing\n* Using LLMs after pre-training",
            "**Transformer Components**\n\nThe Transformer model comprises several key components:\n\n* **Input:** The raw textual data.\n* **Tokenization:**  The process of breaking down the input text into individual units, or tokens (words, subwords, or characters). Each token is then assigned a unique numerical identifier.\n* **Input Embedding:**  Tokens are represented as dense vectors in a continuous Euclidean space. This embedding captures semantic relationships between words, placing similar words closer together and dissimilar words further apart.\n* **Positional Encoding:**  Since the attention mechanism is order-agnostic, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings.  These encodings provide information about the position of each token in the sequence, enabling the model to understand word order.\n* **Encoder:** Processes the input sequence to generate an intermediate representation. It consists of multiple identical layers, each employing self-attention and a feed-forward network.\n* **Decoder:** Generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation. It also uses masked self-attention to prevent \"peeking\" at future tokens during training.\n* **Output:** The generated sequence of tokens, which can then be converted back to text.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Input: Tokenization**\n\nTokenization is a fundamental step in NLP.  It transforms text into a sequence of discrete units (tokens), which are then mapped to unique numerical IDs. This process allows the model to represent and process textual data in a structured manner.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Input Embedding**\n\nWord embeddings are crucial for representing words in a format that machine learning models can understand. They project tokens into a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.  Similar words tend to have similar vector representations, allowing the model to learn meaningful associations.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Positional Encoding**\n\nThe attention mechanism, while powerful, doesn't inherently consider word order.  Positional encodings address this limitation by adding position-specific information to the input embeddings. These encodings utilize periodic functions (sine and cosine) to create unique representations for each position.  This ensures that the model differentiates between sequences with the same words in different orders.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Encoder**\n\nThe encoder transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation.  It consists of stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer.  Crucially, the encoder processes all input tokens in parallel, a key advantage over sequential RNNs.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Self Attention**\n\nSelf-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when encoding a specific word.  It helps the model understand relationships between words within the same sentence.  For example, in the sentence \"The animal didn‚Äôt cross the street because it was too wide,\" self-attention helps the model associate \"it\" with \"the street\" rather than \"the animal.\"\n\nThe attention mechanism employs three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).  These matrices are derived from the input embeddings through linear transformations.  The attention weights are calculated using scaled dot-product attention, which measures the similarity between query and key vectors.  These weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the input sequence.  The scaling factor (1/‚àödk) is crucial for preventing extremely small gradients during training, especially with high-dimensional vectors."

            "**Testing Metrics**\n\nEvaluating classifier performance requires appropriate metrics.  For multi-class and multi-label problems, several averaging methods are used:\n\n* **Micro Average:**  Calculates metrics globally by considering the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives across all classes. This approach is sensitive to class imbalance.\n* **Macro Average:** Computes the metric for each class independently and then averages the results. This treats all classes equally, regardless of their size.\n* **Weighted Average:**  Averages the metric for each class, weighted by the number of true instances (support) for each class. This balances the influence of different class sizes.\n* **Samples Average:** Calculates metrics at the instance level, averaging the performance across individual samples. This is particularly relevant for multi-label classification where each instance can have multiple labels.\n\n**Testing Results (Code Example and Output Included in Original Submission)**\n\nThis section presents the results of the classifier evaluation, including the chosen metrics.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n**Sentiment Analysis Exercise**\n\nSentiment analysis, a specific application of text classification, aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in text (positive, negative, or neutral).

            "### Intro to Text Generation\n\n#### Generative Models\n\nGenerative models are a class of machine learning models designed to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new data points that resemble the training data. Unlike discriminative models, which are used for classification or regression tasks, generative models are concerned with creating original data.  RNNs and Transformers are prominent examples of generative models used in NLP.\n\n\n#### Applications\n\nText generation has a wide range of applications in various fields:\n\n* **Machine Translation:**  Generating text in a target language given text in a source language.\n* **Question Answering:** Generating answers to given questions.\n* **Automatic Summarization:**  Generating concise summaries of longer texts.\n* **Text Completion:**  Predicting the next words in a given text prompt.\n* **Dialogue Systems:** Generating responses in a conversational setting.\n* **Creative Writing:**  Generating poems, scripts, stories, and other forms of creative text.\n\n\n\n#### Language Model\n\nA language model (LM) assigns probabilities to sequences of words. It predicts the probability of the next word in a sequence given the preceding words.  This allows the model to capture the statistical structure of language, learning the likelihood of different word combinations. New text sequences are generated by sampling from this probability distribution, starting with a seed text and iteratively adding predicted tokens.\n\n\n#### LM Training\n\nAn RNN-based language model is trained by feeding it sequences of tokens. At each time step, the RNN receives a token and predicts the next one in the sequence. The prediction is compared with the actual next token in the training data, and the error is backpropagated to update the network‚Äôs weights.  This process is repeated for each token in each sequence in the training corpus.\n\n\n\n#### Sampling\n\nGenerative models employ sampling techniques to introduce randomness and diversity into the generated text.  Instead of always selecting the word with the highest predicted probability, the model samples from the probability distribution, allowing for less likely but potentially more creative or interesting word choices.\n\n\n\n#### Temperature\n\nTemperature (T) is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the sampling process.  It modifies the probability distribution before sampling:\n\n`q_i = exp(log(p_i) / T) / sum(exp(log(p_j) / T))`\n\nwhere `p_i` is the original probability of the i-th word and `q_i` is the modified probability after applying the temperature.\n\n* **Lower Temperatures (T < 1):** Make the model more deterministic, favoring words with higher probabilities. This results in more predictable and less diverse text.\n* **Higher Temperatures (T > 1):** Increase randomness and surprise, allowing the model to sample less likely words. This leads to more creative and diverse but potentially less coherent text.",
            "### Key Rasa Files and Commands (Detailed)\n\n\n**`domain.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\nintents:\n- greet\n- goodbye\n- ...\n\nresponses:\n  utter_greet:\n  - text: \"Hey! How are you?\"\n  utter_goodbye:\n  - text: \"Bye\"\n  ...\n\nsession_config:\n  session_expiration_time: 60  # minutes\n  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true\n```\n\nThe `session_config` section manages conversation sessions. `session_expiration_time` defines the inactivity duration before a session expires. `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines if slot values are preserved across sessions.  This is useful for maintaining context if a user returns after a short break.\n\n**`nlu.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- intent: greet\n  examples: |\n    - hey\n    - hello\n    - hi\n    - ...\n```\n\nRasa requires a sufficient number of examples (7-10 minimum) per intent to effectively train the NLU model to recognize and classify user intentions.  These examples should cover variations in phrasing and vocabulary.\n\n**`stories.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- story: happy path\n  steps:\n  - intent: greet\n  - action: utter_greet\n  - intent: mood_great\n  - action: utter_happy\n```\n\nStories define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions. They serve as training data for the dialogue management model to learn appropriate responses in different conversational contexts.\n\n**`rules.yml` (Example):**\n\n```yaml\n- rule: Say goodbye anytime the user says goodbye\n  steps:\n  - intent: goodbye\n  - action: utter_goodbye\n```\n\nRules specify simple, deterministic dialogue flows. Unlike stories, rules are not used for training a machine learning model; they are applied directly as hard-coded logic.\n\n\n**Visualizing Stories:**  Use `rasa visualize` to generate a graphical representation of the conversation flows defined in your stories. This helps in understanding and debugging the dialogue flow.\n\n\n**Rasa Commands:**\n\n* `rasa train`: Trains the NLU and dialogue management models using the data in the `data` directory and the configuration in `config.yml`.  The trained models are saved in the `models` directory.\n\n* `rasa shell`: Starts an interactive shell where you can test the trained chatbot by typing messages.  This allows you to interact with the bot and evaluate its responses in a controlled environment.\n\n* `rasa run`: Starts a server to deploy the chatbot, making it accessible via HTTP.  The `--cors \"*\" ` option enables cross-origin requests, allowing interaction from web applications hosted on different domains.\n\n* `rasa -h`: Displays help information and lists all available commands.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n### Rasa REST API\n\nRasa offers a REST API for integrating the chatbot with external systems.  This enables communication between your chatbot and web applications, mobile apps, or other services.\n\n* **REST Channel Configuration:** Add the REST channel to your `credentials.yml` file to enable the REST endpoint.  Restart the Rasa server for the changes to take effect.\n\n* **REST Endpoint:**  The bot becomes accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook` after configuring and restarting the server.

The enhanced version focuses on the core concepts of RAG and LangChain, providing concise explanations and relevant code examples.  For a complete understanding of the topics discussed, referring to the original book is recommended.  This separation allows the lesson notes to serve as a focused introduction and guide, while the book provides in-depth knowledge and broader context.\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models\n\n**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**\n\n**Lesson 21: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**\n\n**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**\n\n**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a crucial technique for refining Large Language Models (LLMs).

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",
            "### Intro to Text Generation\n\n#### Generative Models\n\nGenerative models are a class of machine learning models designed to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new data points that resemble the training data. Unlike discriminative models, which are used for classification or regression tasks, generative models are concerned with creating original data.  RNNs and Transformers are prominent examples of generative models used in NLP.\n\n\n#### Applications\n\nText generation has a wide range of applications in various fields:\n\n* **Machine Translation:**  Generating text in a target language given text in a source language.\n* **Question Answering:** Generating answers to given questions.\n* **Automatic Summarization:**  Generating concise summaries of longer texts.\n* **Text Completion:**  Predicting the next words in a given text prompt.\n* **Dialogue Systems:** Generating responses in a conversational setting.\n* **Creative Writing:**  Generating poems, scripts, stories, and other forms of creative text.\n\n\n\n#### Language Model\n\nA language model (LM) assigns probabilities to sequences of words. It predicts the probability of the next word in a sequence given the preceding words.  This allows the model to capture the statistical structure of language, learning the likelihood of different word combinations. New text sequences are generated by sampling from this probability distribution, starting with a seed text and iteratively adding predicted tokens.\n\n\n#### LM Training\n\nAn RNN-based language model is trained by feeding it sequences of tokens. At each time step, the RNN receives a token and predicts the next one in the sequence. The prediction is compared with the actual next token in the training data, and the error is backpropagated to update the network‚Äôs weights.  This process is repeated for each token in each sequence in the training corpus.\n\n\n\n#### Sampling\n\nGenerative models employ sampling techniques to introduce randomness and diversity into the generated text.  Instead of always selecting the word with the highest predicted probability, the model samples from the probability distribution, allowing for less likely but potentially more creative or interesting word choices.\n\n\n\n#### Temperature\n\nTemperature (T) is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the sampling process.  It modifies the probability distribution before sampling:\n\n`q_i = exp(log(p_i) / T) / sum(exp(log(p_j) / T))`\n\nwhere `p_i` is the original probability of the i-th word and `q_i` is the modified probability after applying the temperature.\n\n* **Lower Temperatures (T < 1):** Make the model more deterministic, favoring words with higher probabilities. This results in more predictable and less diverse text.\n* **Higher Temperatures (T > 1):** Increase randomness and surprise, allowing the model to sample less likely words. This leads to more creative and diverse but potentially less coherent text.",
            "**Testing Metrics**\n\nEvaluating classifier performance requires appropriate metrics.  For multi-class and multi-label problems, several averaging methods are used:\n\n* **Micro Average:**  Calculates metrics globally by considering the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives across all classes. This approach is sensitive to class imbalance.\n* **Macro Average:** Computes the metric for each class independently and then averages the results. This treats all classes equally, regardless of their size.\n* **Weighted Average:**  Averages the metric for each class, weighted by the number of true instances (support) for each class. This balances the influence of different class sizes.\n* **Samples Average:** Calculates metrics at the instance level, averaging the performance across individual samples. This is particularly relevant for multi-label classification where each instance can have multiple labels.\n\n**Testing Results (Code Example and Output Included in Original Submission)**\n\nThis section presents the results of the classifier evaluation, including the chosen metrics.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n**Sentiment Analysis Exercise**\n\nSentiment analysis, a specific application of text classification, aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in text (positive, negative, or neutral). Its applications are wide-ranging, including:\n\n* **Business:** Understanding customer feedback and brand perception.\n* **Finance:**  Gauging market sentiment and predicting stock movements.\n* **Politics:** Analyzing public opinion and political discourse.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**IMDB Dataset**\n\nThe IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks.  Its balanced class distribution simplifies evaluation.  The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews.\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n**Exercise**\n\nThe exercise involves building a sentiment classifier using the IMDB dataset:\n\n1. **Data Preparation:** Download and preprocess the IMDB dataset, splitting it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n2. **Label Encoding:** One-hot encode the sentiment labels (positive/negative) using `OneHotEncoder`.\n3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Create TF-IDF vectors from the movie reviews, considering words appearing in at least 5 documents to reduce dimensionality and computational cost.\n4. **Model Training:** Train a classifier (e.g., an MLP or another suitable algorithm) using the vectorized reviews and encoded labels.\n5. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the classifier's performance on the test set using relevant metrics and visualize the results with a confusion matrix, plotted using a Seaborn heatmap. This helps visualize the model's performance in classifying positive and negative reviews.\n\n**Suggestions**\n\nSpecific tools and techniques are suggested for the exercise:\n\n* `OneHotEncoder` for label encoding.\n* TF-IDF vectorization with a minimum document frequency of 5.\n* `confusion_matrix` for generating the confusion matrix.\n* Seaborn heatmaps for visualization (install with `pip install seaborn`; documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html).\n\n\n**Exercise Results (Code Example, Graphs, and Output Included in Original Submission)**\n\n\n<----------section---------->\n\n\n**Text Classification Applications**\n\nBeyond topic labeling and sentiment analysis, text classification has diverse applications:\n\n* Spam Filtering\n* Intent Detection (understanding user requests in chatbots and virtual assistants)\n* Language Detection\n* Content Moderation (identifying inappropriate content)\n* Product Categorization\n* Author Attribution (determining the likely author of a text)\n* Content Recommendation\n* Ad Click Prediction\n* Job Matching\n* Legal Case Classification",

            "### Term Frequency\n\nTerm Frequency (TF) quantifies the importance of a word within a document based on its frequency of occurrence.  The underlying assumption is that words appearing more frequently are more central to the document's topic.  A common approach to represent text using TF is the Bag of Words (BoW) model.\n\n**Bag of Words (BoW):**\n\nThe BoW model represents text as a vector of word counts, disregarding word order and grammar.  Different variations exist:\n\n* **One-hot Encoding:** Each word in the vocabulary is represented as a vector with a single '1' at the index corresponding to the word and '0' elsewhere.  These vectors are combined to represent a document.\n\n* **Binary BoW:** One-hot vectors are combined using the OR operation.  The resulting vector indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each word in the vocabulary within the document.\n\n* **Standard BoW:** One-hot vectors are summed.  The resulting vector represents the count of each word in the vocabulary within the document.\n\n* **Term Frequency (TF):**  While related to the Standard BoW, the TF specifically focuses on the raw counts of each word.\n\n\n**Python Example:**\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how to extract tokens, build a BoW model, and calculate TF using the `spaCy` and `collections` libraries in Python:\n\n```python\n# Extract tokens\nsentence = \"The faster Harry got to the store, the faster Harry, the faster, would get home.\"\n\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\") # load the language model\ndoc = nlp(sentence)\n\ntokens = [tok.lower_ for tok in doc if not tok.is_stop and not tok.is_punct]\n\nprint(tokens)\n\n# Build BoW with word count\n\nimport collections\n\nbag_of_words = collections.Counter(tokens) # counts the elements of a list\nprint(bag_of_words)\n\n# Most common words\nprint(bag_of_words.most_common(2)) # most common 2 words\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncounts = pd.Series(bag_of_words) # from dict to Pandas Series\nprint(counts / counts.sum()) # calculate TF\n```\n\n**Limitations of TF:**\n\nRelying solely on raw word counts can be misleading.  A word appearing many times in a long document might not be as significant as the same word appearing fewer times in a short document.\n\n**Illustrative Example:**\n\nConsider two documents:\n\n* Document A: A 30-word email mentioning \"dog\" 3 times.\n* Document B: The novel *War & Peace* (approximately 580,000 words) mentioning \"dog\" 100 times.\n\nWhile \"dog\" appears more frequently in Document B, its relative importance is higher in Document A.\n\n\n### Normalized TF\n\nNormalized TF addresses the limitations of raw TF by dividing the word count by the total number of words in the document.\n\n* TF (dog, Document A) = 3/30 = 0.1\n* TF (dog, Document B) = 100/580000 = 0.00017\n\nThis normalization provides a more accurate representation of a word's importance relative to the document length.",
            "### Bag of Words Representation\n\n**Turning Words into Numbers: One-hot Vectors**\n\nOne-hot encoding represents each word in a vocabulary as a vector. The vector's length equals the vocabulary size, and only the element corresponding to the word's index is 1; all others are 0.  While this preserves all information and allows document reconstruction, it creates very sparse, high-dimensional vectors.\n\n**Limitations of One-hot Vectors:**\n\nThe sparsity leads to massive memory requirements for large vocabularies and corpora.  For example, a vocabulary of one million words and a corpus of 3,000 short books (3,500 sentences per book, 15 words per sentence) would require around 17.9 TB of storage using one-hot vectors, making it impractical.\n\n**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**\n\nBoW addresses the sparsity issue by summing the one-hot vectors for all words in a document.  This results in a single vector where each element represents the count of a specific word in the document.  While BoW is more memory-efficient, it loses word order information, which can be crucial for understanding meaning.  A binary variant of BoW simply indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word, disregarding its frequency.\n\n**Binary BoW: Example**\n\nConsider the corpus:\n\n```python\nsentences = [\n    \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\",\n    \"Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.\",\n    \"In addition to being a painter, Leonardo da Vinci was also a skilled engineer.\",\n    \"Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle.\",\n    \"The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most prestigious events in tennis.\",\n    \"A tennis match is typically played as a best of three or best of five sets.\"\n]\n```\n\nBy generating a vocabulary and BoW vectors, we can observe the overlap in word usage between sentences.  This overlap, quantifiable using metrics like the dot product, allows us to compare documents and identify similarities.  BoW is foundational for document retrieval and search due to its efficiency and compatibility with hardware-accelerated binary operations."

The code demonstrates how to set up training arguments, configure the data collator for causal language modeling (non-masked language modeling), and initiate the training process. The discussion elaborates on the importance of the `mlm=False` setting for causal language models, distinguishing them from masked language models like BERT. It also touches upon the concept of causal language models and draws parallels with how humans process language sequentially. The code further illustrates how to generate text using the fine-tuned model and compares the generated output with that of the original, pre-trained model.  It emphasizes the impact of fine-tuning on the generated text and encourages exploring alternative training approaches beyond using the Hugging Face `Trainer`. The additional context excerpts discuss various topics related to transformers, their architecture, training processes, applications, and limitations, providing a deeper understanding of the subject matter. It also covers specific models like BERT, GPT-2, and their variants, along with practical considerations for training and deployment. It discusses the importance of ethical considerations and responsible use of large language models, highlighting the potential risks and biases associated with these powerful technologies.  Finally, it provides resources and further learning opportunities for those interested in delving deeper into the field of natural language processing and large language models."

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",

            "**Additional Context and Insights**\n\nThe core innovation of the Transformer model lies in its use of self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to consider the relationships between all words in a sequence simultaneously. This contrasts with RNNs, which process sequences sequentially. The parallel processing capabilities of transformers, coupled with their ability to handle long-range dependencies, have made them a cornerstone of modern NLP.\n\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE), a subword tokenization technique, is often used with transformers to handle large vocabularies efficiently. BPE allows the model to represent rare or unseen words as combinations of more frequent subword units.\n\nTransformers are highly scalable, meaning their capacity can be increased by stacking more layers and using larger datasets.  This scalability, combined with the parallelizability of attention, has enabled the development of extremely large language models (LLMs) capable of performing complex tasks like question answering, text generation, and translation.\n\n\nThe omission of recurrence in Transformers necessitates positional encodings to incorporate word order information. These encodings are crucial for tasks where word order is essential, like translation and grammar parsing.\n\nThe combination of BPE, self-attention, and positional encoding allows Transformers to effectively handle long sequences and capture complex relationships between words, leading to significant advancements in NLP.  These models can learn rich representations of text, enabling them to outperform traditional methods on various tasks. The attention mechanism is a key component of this success, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating the output.",

            "`\n\n### Multi-head Attention\n\nSelf-attention allows a model to consider the relationships between different words in a sequence when processing each word. However, a single attention mechanism might not capture all the nuances of these relationships. Multi-head attention addresses this limitation by employing multiple \"heads,\" each with its own set of learned weight matrices.  This allows the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously.\n\nEach head performs a scaled dot-product attention operation. The results from these parallel computations are then concatenated and transformed through another linear layer. This final transformation combines the various perspectives offered by the different heads into a unified representation.  Multi-head attention allows the model to capture a richer understanding of the relationships within the sequence compared to a single-head approach.\n\nJust like in single-head attention, Multi-Head Attention incorporates Add & Norm (skip connections and layer normalization) and Feed Forward layers. The Add & Norm component normalizes the output, stabilizing training and providing a regularization effect, while the residual connections (Add) help mitigate vanishing gradients, which is crucial for training deep networks.

Key innovations include:\n\n* **Self-Attention:**  This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each word, capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than recurrent networks, which struggle with vanishing gradients over long sequences.\n\n* **Scalability:** The lack of recurrence and the parallelizable nature of attention computations allow Transformers to be scaled to much larger datasets and model sizes than RNNs or CNNs. This scalability has been instrumental in the development of large language models.\n\n* **Stackability:** The consistent input and output dimensions of Transformer layers facilitate stacking multiple layers, enabling the model to learn increasingly complex representations of the input data.\n\n* **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE):** While not part of the core Transformer architecture, BPE plays a critical role in handling large vocabularies efficiently by representing words as subword units.  This helps reduce the vocabulary size and addresses the out-of-vocabulary problem.\n\n* **Positional Encodings:**  These encodings compensate for the lack of inherent positional information in self-attention, allowing the model to account for word order in the input sequence.\n\nThese innovations, combined with the ability to train on massive datasets, have led to significant performance improvements in various NLP tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and text generation. The Transformer‚Äôs ability to capture long-range dependencies and be trained efficiently has been particularly crucial for the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) which demonstrate impressive abilities in understanding and generating human-like text.",

            "### Writing Good Prompts\n\nCrafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:\n\n* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.\n* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., \"Write,\" \"Classify,\" \"Summarize\") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.\n* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.\n* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.\n* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThe following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Summarize this article.\"  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings.\" Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Write an apology email to a client.\"  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate.\" Provides specific details and instructions.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Make this explanation easier to understand.\" Lacks target audience information.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students.\" Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Classify the following review.\" Lacks classification categories.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative.\" Provides specific classification categories.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Tell me about exercise benefits.\"  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being.\" Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.\n\n* **Bad Prompt:** \"Translate this sentence to French.\" Lacks information about tone or style.\n* **Good Prompt:** \"Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone.\"  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.",

            "### Bag of Words Representation\n\n**Turning Words into Numbers: One-hot Vectors**\n\nOne-hot encoding represents each word in a vocabulary as a vector. The vector's length equals the vocabulary size, and only the element corresponding to the word's index is 1; all others are 0.  While this preserves all information and allows document reconstruction, it creates very sparse, high-dimensional vectors.\n\n**Limitations of One-hot Vectors:**\n\nThe sparsity leads to massive memory requirements for large vocabularies and corpora.  For example, a vocabulary of one million words and a corpus of 3,000 short books (3,500 sentences per book, 15 words per sentence) would require around 17.9 TB of storage using one-hot vectors, making it impractical.\n\n**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**\n\nBoW addresses the sparsity issue by summing the one-hot vectors for all words in a document.  This results in a single vector where each element represents the count of a specific word in the document.  While BoW is more memory-efficient, it loses word order information, which can be crucial for understanding meaning.  A binary variant of BoW simply indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word, disregarding its frequency.\n\n**Binary BoW: Example**\n\nConsider the corpus:\n\n```python\nsentences = [\n    \"Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.\",\n    \"Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.\",\n    \"In addition to being a painter, Leonardo da Vinci was also a skilled engineer.\",\n    \"Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle.\",\n    \"The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most prestigious events in tennis.\",\n    \"A tennis match is typically played as a best of three or best of five sets.\"\n]\n```\n\nBy generating a vocabulary and BoW vectors, we can observe the overlap in word usage between sentences.  This overlap, quantifiable using metrics like the dot product, allows us to compare documents and identify similarities.  BoW is foundational for document retrieval and search due to its efficiency and compatibility with hardware-accelerated binary operations.",
            "### Term Frequency\n\nTerm Frequency (TF) quantifies the importance of a word within a document based on its frequency of occurrence.  The underlying assumption is that words appearing more frequently are more central to the document's topic.  A common approach to represent text using TF is the Bag of Words (BoW) model.\n\n**Bag of Words (BoW):**\n\nThe BoW model represents text as a vector of word counts, disregarding word order and grammar.  Different variations exist:\n\n* **One-hot Encoding:** Each word in the vocabulary is represented as a vector with a single '1' at the index corresponding to the word and '0' elsewhere.  These vectors are combined to represent a document.\n\n* **Binary BoW:** One-hot vectors are combined using the OR operation.  The resulting vector indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each word in the vocabulary within the document.\n\n* **Standard BoW:** One-hot vectors are summed.  The resulting vector represents the count of each word in the vocabulary within the document.\n\n* **Term Frequency (TF):**  While related to the Standard BoW, the TF specifically focuses on the raw counts of each word.\n\n\n**Python Example:**\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how to extract tokens, build a BoW model, and calculate TF using the `spaCy` and `collections` libraries in Python:\n\n```python\n# Extract tokens\nsentence = \"The faster Harry got to the store, the faster Harry, the faster, would get home.\"\n\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\") # load the language model\ndoc = nlp(sentence)\n\ntokens = [tok.lower_ for tok in doc if not tok.is_stop and not tok.is_punct]\n\nprint(tokens)\n\n# Build BoW with word count\n\nimport collections\n\nbag_of_words = collections.Counter(tokens) # counts the elements of a list\nprint(bag_of_words)\n\n# Most common words\nprint(bag_of_words.most_common(2)) # most common 2 words\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncounts = pd.Series(bag_of_words) # from dict to Pandas Series\nprint(counts / counts.sum()) # calculate TF\n```\n\n**Limitations of TF:**\n\nRelying solely on raw word counts can be misleading.  A word appearing many times in a long document might not be as significant as the same word appearing fewer times in a short document.\n\n**Illustrative Example:**\n\nConsider two documents:\n\n* Document A: A 30-word email mentioning \"dog\" 3 times.\n* Document B: The novel *War & Peace* (approximately 580,000 words) mentioning \"dog\" 100 times.\n\nWhile \"dog\" appears more frequently in Document B, its relative importance is higher in Document A.\n\n\n### Normalized TF\n\nNormalized TF addresses the limitations of raw TF by dividing the word count by the total number of words in the document.\n\n* TF (dog, Document A) = 3/30 = 0.1\n* TF (dog, Document B) = 100/580000 = 0.00017\n\nThis normalization provides a more accurate representation of a word's importance relative to the document length.",
            "**Types of Classification**\n\n* **Single-label:** Each document is assigned to exactly one class. This is appropriate when categories are mutually exclusive.\n* **Binary:** A special case of single-label classification with only two classes (e.g., spam/not spam).  It simplifies the problem to a yes/no decision regarding a single category.\n* **Multi-label:**  A document can belong to multiple classes simultaneously (e.g., a news article categorized as both \"finance\" and \"politics\").  This type acknowledges that documents can address multiple topics or themes.",
            "### Stories, Rules, and Slots\n\n\n* **`stories.yml`:** Stories are sequences of user intents and bot actions, used to train the dialogue management model.  They represent example conversation flows.  Stories can include OR statements to define different paths for the same intent and checkpoints to link to other stories, creating modular and reusable conversation flows.\n\n* **`rules.yml`:**  Rules are hard-coded dialogue flows for specific scenarios. They are not used for training but are applied directly. They are suitable for short, predictable interactions.\n\n* **Slots:** Slots are variables used to store information extracted from user input. They are defined in the `domain.yml` file and are often connected to entities.  Slot mappings define how slots are filled, including conditions based on intents and roles.  Slots can be used in responses to create dynamic and personalized messages."

Key takeaways regarding Rasa include:\n\n* **Intent-Based Architecture:** Rasa employs an intent-based approach, focusing on understanding the user's intention (e.g., requesting the menu, placing an order) and responding with appropriate actions.\n* **Components and Pipelines:**  Rasa utilizes a pipeline of components for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), including tokenization, featurization, and classification.  These components work together to process user input and extract relevant information.\n* **Stories and Training:**  Rasa uses \"stories\" to define conversational flows and train its dialogue management model.  Stories are sequences of user intents and chatbot actions that represent example conversations.\n* **Custom Actions:** Custom actions, written in Python, allow developers to extend Rasa's functionality, enabling integration with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs) and complex logic.\n* **Configuration and Customization:** Rasa offers extensive configuration options, allowing developers to tailor the NLU pipeline and dialogue management to their specific needs.\n\nThe broader context emphasizes the importance of data-driven conversation design, iteratively improving the chatbot based on user interactions and feedback.  This involves analyzing conversation logs, identifying user pain points, and refining the chatbot's responses and logic.

            "### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n\nLoRA operates on the principle that the changes needed to adapt a pre-trained model to a new task can be effectively captured by a low-rank representation.  This allows for substantial parameter savings while maintaining performance.\n\n1. **Base Model Weights (W):** The pre-trained transformer model is characterized by its weight matrices *W*.\n2. **Low-Rank Decomposition (ŒîW = A √ó B):**  Instead of directly modifying *W*, LoRA learns a low-rank decomposition of the weight update Œî*W*. This update is represented as the product of two low-rank matrices, *A* (m√ór) and *B* (r√ón), where *r* is the rank, significantly smaller than the dimensions *m* and *n* of *W*.\n3. **Weight Update (W' = W + ŒîW):** During fine-tuning, the effective weight matrix *W'* is computed as the sum of the original weights *W* and the low-rank update Œî*W*.\n\n**How LoRA Works:**\n\n* **Frozen Pre-trained Weights:**  The original weights *W* remain frozen, preserving the general knowledge acquired during pre-training.\n* **Task-Specific Knowledge Injection:** The low-rank matrices *A* and *B* encode the task-specific knowledge, requiring significantly fewer parameters than updating the full weight matrix.\n* **Parameter Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is dramatically reduced, making LoRA highly efficient.\n* **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the low-rank update can be efficiently applied to the frozen weights, ensuring fast and memory-efficient deployment.",

            "### Introduction to RAG\n\n**What is RAG?**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) possess broad reasoning capabilities, yet they face inherent limitations:\n\n* **Knowledge Cutoff:**  Their knowledge is confined to the data they were trained on.  This creates a \"cutoff\" date beyond which they are unaware of new information, world events, or evolving scientific understanding.\n* **Inability to Access External Information:** LLMs, in their standard form, operate in isolation and cannot access real-time information from the internet or other external sources. This restricts their ability to respond to queries requiring current data.\n* **Handling Private and Proprietary Data:**  Standard LLMs are not designed to process private or proprietary information.  Submitting such data to publicly available LLMs poses security risks and potential breaches of confidentiality.\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by enriching LLMs with access to external and private data sources. This technique allows AI applications to leverage the power of LLMs while grounding their responses in specific, relevant information, broadening their knowledge beyond the training data and enabling them to work with sensitive data securely.\n\n\n**RAG Concepts**\n\nRAG applications typically involve two key stages:\n\n* **Indexing (Offline):**  This process involves ingesting data from various sources and preparing it for efficient retrieval.  The data is transformed into a searchable format, often involving splitting large documents into smaller, manageable chunks and converting them into vector representations.\n* **Retrieval and Generation (Runtime):** When a user submits a query, the system retrieves relevant information from the indexed data. This retrieved context is then integrated into a prompt that is fed to the LLM.  The LLM, now armed with pertinent information, generates a more informed and contextually appropriate response.\n\n\n**Indexing**\n\nThe indexing stage consists of three main steps:\n\n* **Load:**  Data is loaded from various sources, including files (PDF, CSV, HTML, JSON), websites, databases, and other repositories.  RAG frameworks often provide specialized loaders to handle different data formats.\n* **Split (Chunking):**  Long documents are divided into smaller chunks.  This is crucial for two reasons: (1) smaller chunks are easier to search and retrieve efficiently, and (2) they fit within the limited context window of LLMs.\n* **Store (Vectorization):**  The data chunks are stored in a Vector Store. This involves converting text chunks into vector representations (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based search.\n\n\n**Vector Stores**\n\nVector Stores are specialized databases designed for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.\n\n* **Embeddings Recap:** Embeddings are mathematical representations of text that capture semantic relationships between words and phrases.  Similar concepts have similar vector representations.\n* **Semantic Search:** Vector stores enable semantic search, where retrieval is based on the meaning of the query and the indexed data, rather than just keyword matching. This allows for more accurate and relevant retrieval of information.\n\n\n**Retrieval and Generation**\n\nThe runtime process involves:\n\n* **Retrieval:** Based on the user's query, the system retrieves the most relevant data chunks from the Vector Store, using similarity search based on embeddings.\n* **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved data is incorporated into a prompt along with the user's query.\n* **LLM Generation:** This augmented prompt is fed to the LLM, enabling it to generate a response grounded in the retrieved context."

            "**Self Attention**\n\nSelf-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when encoding a specific word.  It helps the model understand relationships between words within the same sentence.  For example, in the sentence \"The animal didn‚Äôt cross the street because it was too wide,\" self-attention helps the model associate \"it\" with \"the street\" rather than \"the animal.\"\n\nThe attention mechanism employs three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).  These matrices are derived from the input embeddings through linear transformations.  The attention weights are calculated using scaled dot-product attention, which measures the similarity between query and key vectors.  These weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the input sequence.  The scaling factor (1/‚àödk) is crucial for preventing extremely small gradients during training, especially with high-dimensional vectors.",
            "`\n\n### Multi-head Attention\n\nSelf-attention allows a model to consider the relationships between different words in a sequence when processing each word. However, a single attention mechanism might not capture all the nuances of these relationships. Multi-head attention addresses this limitation by employing multiple \"heads,\" each with its own set of learned weight matrices.  This allows the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously.\n\nEach head performs a scaled dot-product attention operation. The results from these parallel computations are then concatenated and transformed through another linear layer. This final transformation combines the various perspectives offered by the different heads into a unified representation.  Multi-head attention allows the model to capture a richer understanding of the relationships within the sequence compared to a single-head approach.\n\nJust like in single-head attention, Multi-Head Attention incorporates Add & Norm (skip connections and layer normalization) and Feed Forward layers. The Add & Norm component normalizes the output, stabilizing training and providing a regularization effect, while the residual connections (Add) help mitigate vanishing gradients, which is crucial for training deep networks. The Feed Forward layers introduce non-linear transformations, enabling the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships between words in the sequence.\n\n\n`",

            "### BERT Pre-training\n\nBERT's pre-training involves two unsupervised tasks:\n\n* **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Randomly masking a percentage of input tokens (usually 15%) and training the model to predict these masked tokens based on the surrounding context. This bidirectional training approach enables BERT to learn deep contextual representations.  Variations in masking strategies, such as dynamic masking where the masked tokens change during training epochs, further improve the robustness of the learned representations.\n\n* **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Training the model to predict whether two given sentences are consecutive in the original text. Although its effectiveness has been debated, and some subsequent models like RoBERTa have omitted it, it aims to teach the model about inter-sentence relationships.\n\nThese pre-training tasks utilize a massive text corpus (BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia), exposing the model to a diverse range of language structures and semantics."
