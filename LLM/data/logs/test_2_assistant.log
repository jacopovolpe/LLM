        "## Additional Context\n\nHere is further relevant context to the topic covered.\n\nPopular sampling techniques that are often used in practice are top-k sampling and nucleus sampling. We won’t discuss all of them here - you can read more about them in HuggingFace’s excellent guide.\n[\n26\n]\nLet’s try to generate text using nucleus sampling method. In this method, instead of choosing among the K most likely words, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is smaller than p. So if there are only a few candidates with large probabilities, the \"nucleus\" would be smaller, than in the case of larger group of candidates with smaller probabilities. Note that because sampling is probabilistic, the generated text will be different for you - this is not something that can be controlled with a random seed.\n\nListing 10.7 Generating text using nucleus sampling method\n```python\n>>> nucleus_sampling_args = {\n...    'do_sample': True,\n...    'max_length': 50,\n...    'top_p': 0.92\n... }\n>>> print(generate(prompt='NLP is a', **nucleus_sampling_args))\n```\nNLP is a multi-level network protocol, which is one of the most well-documented protocols for managing data transfer protocols. This is useful if one can perform network transfers using one data transfer protocol and another protocol or protocol in the same chain.\nOK. This is better, but still not quite what you were looking for. Your output still uses the same words too much (just count how many times \"protocol\" was mentioned!) But more importantly, though NLP indeed can stand for Network Layer Protocol, it’s not what you were looking for. To get generated text that is domain-specific, you need to fine-tune our model - that means, to train it on a dataset that is specific to our task.\n\n### 10.1.7 Fine-tuning your generative model\nIn your case, this dataset would be this very book, parsed into a database of lines. Let’s load it from nlpia2 repository. In this case, we only need the book’s text, so we’ll ignore code, headers, and all other things that will not be helpful for our generative model.\nLet’s also initialize a new version of our GPT-2 model for finetuning. We can reuse the tokenizer for GPT-2 we initialized before.\n\nListing 10.8 Loading the NLPiA2 lines as training data for GPT-2\n```python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> DATASET_URL = ('https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/'\n...     '-/raw/main/src/nlpia2/data/nlpia_lines.csv')\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_URL)\n>>> df = df[df['is_text']]\n>>> lines = df.line_text.copy()\n```\n\nThis will read all the sentences of natural language text in the manuscript for this book. Each line or sentence will be a different \"document\" in your NLP pipeline, so your model will learn how to generate sentences rather than longer passages. You want to wrap your list of sentences with a PyTorch Dataset class so that your text will be structured in the way that our training pipeline expects.\n\nListing 10.9 Creating a PyTorch Dataset for training\n```python\n>>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n>>> from torch.utils.data import random_split\n>>> class NLPiADataset(Dataset):\n>>>     def __init__(self, txt_list, tokenizer, max_length=768):\n>>>         self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n>>>         self.input_ids = []\n>>>         self.attn_masks = []\n>>>         for txt in txt_list:\n>>>             encodings_dict = tokenizer(txt, truncation=True,\n...                 max_length=max_length, padding=\"max_length\")\n>>>             self.input_ids.append(\n...                 torch.tensor(encodings_dict['input_ids']))\n>>>     def __len__(self):\n>>>         return len(self.input_ids)\n>>>     def __getitem__(self, idx):\n>>>         return self.input_ids[idx]\n```\nNow, we want to set aside some samples for evaluating our loss mid-training. Usually, we would need to wrap them in the DataLoader wrapper, but luckily, the Transformers package simplifies things for us.\n\nListing 10.10 Creating training and evaluation sets for fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> dataset = NLPiADataset(lines, tokenizer, max_length=768)\n>>> train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))\n>>> eval_size = len(dataset) - train_size\n>>> train_dataset, eval_dataset = random_split(\n...     dataset, [train_size, eval_size])\n```\n\nFinally, you need one more Transformers library object - DataCollator. It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```",

It uses the spaCy library to tokenize the SMS messages and generate word embeddings. `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')` loads the 'en_core_web_md' model, which includes 300-dimensional word embeddings. The code then iterates through each SMS message (`df['text']`), tokenizes it using `nlp(sample)`, and extracts the word embedding vector (`token.vector`) for each token. Unnecessary pipeline components are disabled for efficiency. The resulting `corpus` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the word embedding vectors for the tokens in an SMS message. A zero vector of the same dimension as word embeddings represents padding, to ensure that all input sequences have the same length.",
        "**Data pre-processing**\n\n*   Once an adequate corpus of data is collected, the subsequent step is data preprocessing, whose quality directly impacts the model’s performance and security. Proper data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and ethical behavior of LLMs.\n*   The specific preprocessing steps involve filtering low-quality text, including eliminating toxic and biased content to ensure the model aligns with human ethical standards. Content moderation techniques are used to identify and remove harmful or inappropriate text from the training data.\n*   It also includes deduplication, removing duplicates in the training set, and excluding redundant content in the test set to maintain the sample distribution balance. Deduplication helps to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n*   Privacy scrubbing is applied to ensure the model’s security, preventing information leakage or other privacy-related concerns. This involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data from the training corpus.\n\n**Quality filtering**\n\n*   Filtering low-quality data is typically done using heuristic-based methods or classifier-based methods. Both techniques aim to remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from the training data.\n*   Heuristic methods involve employing manually defined rules to eliminate low-quality data. For instance, rules could be set to retain only text containing digits, discard sentences composed entirely of uppercase letters, and remove files with a symbol and word ratio exceeding 0.1, and so forth. These rules are based on common characteristics of low-quality text and require careful tuning to avoid inadvertently filtering out valid data.\n*   Classifier-based methods involve training a classifier on a high-quality dataset to filter out low-quality datasets. The classifier learns to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality text, enabling automated filtering of large corpora. This approach requires a labeled dataset of high-quality and low-quality text for training the classifier.\n\n**Deduplication**\n\n*   Language models may sometimes repetitively generate the same content during text generation, potentially due to a high degree of repetition in the training data. Redundancy in the training data can lead to unintended memorization and replication of specific text patterns.\n*   Extensive repetition can lead to training instability, resulting in a decline in the performance of LLMs. Uncontrolled repetition can hinder the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new inputs.\n*   Additionally, it is crucial to consider avoiding dataset contamination by removing duplicated data present in both the training and test set. Overlapping training and test data can lead to artificially inflated performance metrics and hinder the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.",
        "**Privacy scrubbing**\n\n*   LLMs, as text-generating models, are trained on diverse datasets, which may pose privacy concerns and the risk of inadvertent information disclosure. Training on datasets containing PII can create vulnerabilities that allow models to inadvertently reveal sensitive information.\n*   It is imperative to address privacy concerns by systematically removing any sensitive information. This proactive approach helps to mitigate the risk of unintended data breaches and protect individuals' privacy.\n*   This involves employing techniques such as anonymization, redaction, or tokenization to eliminate personally identifiable details, geolocation, and confidential data. These techniques transform or remove sensitive information while preserving the utility of the data for training purposes.\n*   By carefully scrubbing the dataset of such sensitive content, researchers and developers can ensure that the language models trained on these datasets uphold privacy standards and mitigate the risk of unintentional disclosure of private information. Adhering to privacy standards fosters trust and promotes the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Filtering out toxic and biased text**\n\n*   In the preprocessing steps of language datasets, a critical consideration is the removal of toxic and biased content to ensure the development of fair and unbiased language models. Addressing toxicity and bias is essential for creating LLMs that align with human values and promote responsible use.\n*   This involves implementing robust content moderation techniques, such as employing sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and bias identification algorithms. These algorithms are designed to automatically identify and flag text that exhibits harmful or inappropriate characteristics.\n*   By leveraging these tools, it is possible to systematically identify and filter out text that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, offensive language, or biased viewpoints. This process helps to create more inclusive and equitable training datasets, fostering fairness and reducing the risk of perpetuating harmful biases.",
        "`\n\n**Additional Contextual Insights:**\n\n**Hardening NLP Software:** It is crucial to harden your NLP software to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text. Creating \"bug bounties\" incentivizes users to find gaps in your guardrails, turning adversarial curiosity into productive feedback. Open source frameworks, like Guardrails-ai, offer configurable rule templates, acting as real-time unit tests for your system.\n\n**Machine Learning Classifiers:** Traditional machine learning classifiers are effective in detecting malicious intent or inappropriate content in LLM outputs. To prevent the provision of regulated advice (e.g., legal or medical), custom ML models generalize from examples, providing high reliability. These models also protect against prompt injection attacks.\n\n**Advanced Filtering Techniques:** For precise or complex rules, consider open source tools that use languages similar to regular expressions to specify general filter rules. Tools such as SpaCy’s Matcher, ReLM patterns, Eleuther AI’s LM evaluation harness, and Guardrails-AI \"rail\" language aid in specifying these rules. However, guardrails-ai may not fully prevent LLMs from going off the rails but can be helpful in other aspects of rule creation and implementation.\n\n**Guardrails-AI Package Details:** Ensure the correct installation of the `guardrails-ai` package (with the \"-ai\" suffix). This package uses \"RAIL,\" a domain-specific form of XML, to specify guardrail rules for building retrieval-augmented LLMs that don't fake answers, ensuring a fallback to \"I don’t know\" responses when appropriate.\n\n**Alternatives to RAIL:** If XML-based templating is cumbersome, standard Python templating systems like f-strings or jinja2 templates offer better alternatives for building prompt strings. The LangChain package also provides example LLM prompt templates.\n\n**Rule-Based Systems:** For production applications, rule-based systems like SpaCy Matcher patterns are preferable over guardrails-ai or LangChain because they offer fuzzy rules to detect misspellings or transliterations and incorporate NLU semantic matching.\n\n**SpaCy Matcher for Taboo Words:** Configure SpaCy Matcher to avoid taboo words or names, substituting them with synonyms or generic alternatives. This approach can also protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Implementing a bad word detector is a flexible method for any undesirable content.\n\n**Correcting Bad Words with SpaCy Matcher:** To correct bad words with acceptable substitutes, add a separate named matcher for each word in your list, which enables accurate correction even with typos.\n\n**Semantic Matching:** Augment the SpaCy matcher with semantic matching using word embeddings to filter semantically similar words, creating a robust pipeline that improves over time with added data and models.\n\n**Red Teaming:** Employ \"red teaming\" to efficiently build a dataset of edge cases and improve NLP pipeline reliability. Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance. However, the effectiveness of scaling is questioned, with some research indicating that increased dataset size doesn't necessarily create more intelligent behavior but rather more confident and intelligent-sounding text.\n\n**Llama 2 and Open Source Models:** Open source models like BLOOMZ, StableLM, InstructGPT, and Llama2 are optimized for more modest hardware, enabling efficient generalization and more accurate behavior.\n\n**Meta Models:** Building higher-level meta models that utilize LLMs and other NLP pipelines can break down prompts into actionable steps, generating API queries to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n\n**LLM Temperature Parameter:** The temperature parameter in LLMs controls the randomness of generated text. Lower temperatures result in more predictable and consistent outputs, while higher temperatures increase creativity and variability. Understanding and adjusting this parameter is crucial for controlling LLM behavior.\n\n**Teaching Math with LLMs:** While LLMs can successfully improvise onboarding conversations for math tutors, they struggle with math reasoning. Grounding models with specific questions and curating their responses is crucial to ensure reliability.",
        "## Additional Context\n\nHere is further relevant context to the topic covered.\n\nPopular sampling techniques that are often used in practice are top-k sampling and nucleus sampling. We won’t discuss all of them here - you can read more about them in HuggingFace’s excellent guide.\n[\n26\n]\nLet’s try to generate text using nucleus sampling method. In this method, instead of choosing among the K most likely words, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is smaller than p. So if there are only a few candidates with large probabilities, the \"nucleus\" would be smaller, than in the case of larger group of candidates with smaller probabilities. Note that because sampling is probabilistic, the generated text will be different for you - this is not something that can be controlled with a random seed.\n\nListing 10.7 Generating text using nucleus sampling method\n```python\n>>> nucleus_sampling_args = {\n...    'do_sample': True,\n...    'max_length': 50,\n...    'top_p': 0.92\n... }\n>>> print(generate(prompt='NLP is a', **nucleus_sampling_args))\n```\nNLP is a multi-level network protocol, which is one of the most well-documented protocols for managing data transfer protocols. This is useful if one can perform network transfers using one data transfer protocol and another protocol or protocol in the same chain.\nOK. This is better, but still not quite what you were looking for. Your output still uses the same words too much (just count how many times \"protocol\" was mentioned!) But more importantly, though NLP indeed can stand for Network Layer Protocol, it’s not what you were looking for. To get generated text that is domain-specific, you need to fine-tune our model - that means, to train it on a dataset that is specific to our task.\n\n### 10.1.7 Fine-tuning your generative model\nIn your case, this dataset would be this very book, parsed into a database of lines. Let’s load it from nlpia2 repository. In this case, we only need the book’s text, so we’ll ignore code, headers, and all other things that will not be helpful for our generative model.\nLet’s also initialize a new version of our GPT-2 model for finetuning. We can reuse the tokenizer for GPT-2 we initialized before.\n\nListing 10.8 Loading the NLPiA2 lines as training data for GPT-2\n```python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> DATASET_URL = ('https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/'\n...     '-/raw/main/src/nlpia2/data/nlpia_lines.csv')\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_URL)\n>>> df = df[df['is_text']]\n>>> lines = df.line_text.copy()\n```\n\nThis will read all the sentences of natural language text in the manuscript for this book. Each line or sentence will be a different \"document\" in your NLP pipeline, so your model will learn how to generate sentences rather than longer passages. You want to wrap your list of sentences with a PyTorch Dataset class so that your text will be structured in the way that our training pipeline expects.\n\nListing 10.9 Creating a PyTorch Dataset for training\n```python\n>>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n>>> from torch.utils.data import random_split\n>>> class NLPiADataset(Dataset):\n>>>     def __init__(self, txt_list, tokenizer, max_length=768):\n>>>         self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n>>>         self.input_ids = []\n>>>         self.attn_masks = []\n>>>         for txt in txt_list:\n>>>             encodings_dict = tokenizer(txt, truncation=True,\n...                 max_length=max_length, padding=\"max_length\")\n>>>             self.input_ids.append(\n...                 torch.tensor(encodings_dict['input_ids']))\n>>>     def __len__(self):\n>>>         return len(self.input_ids)\n>>>     def __getitem__(self, idx):\n>>>         return self.input_ids[idx]\n```\nNow, we want to set aside some samples for evaluating our loss mid-training. Usually, we would need to wrap them in the DataLoader wrapper, but luckily, the Transformers package simplifies things for us.\n\nListing 10.10 Creating training and evaluation sets for fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> dataset = NLPiADataset(lines, tokenizer, max_length=768)\n>>> train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))\n>>> eval_size = len(dataset) - train_size\n>>> train_dataset, eval_dataset = random_split(\n...     dataset, [train_size, eval_size])\n```\n\nFinally, you need one more Transformers library object - DataCollator. It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```"

    "original_question": "How would you preprocess text data (e.g., emails) to be used as input for the provided `SpamDetector` model?",
    "reformulated_query": "```text\nHow would you preprocess text data (e.g., emails) to be used as input for the SpamDetector model, considering techniques like tokenization, handling of word embeddings, padding/truncation, and cleaning steps such as filtering, deduplication, and privacy scrubbing?\n```",
    "final_response": "<div>\nPreprocessing text data, such as emails, for a SpamDetector model involves several crucial steps to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the input data. Here's a structured response outlining the preprocessing techniques to be applied:\n\n## Tokenization:\nTokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. This step helps in converting the text into a format that can be easily processed by the model. For emails, tokenization can be applied at the word level, splitting the text into individual words while removing punctuation and special characters.\n\n## Handling Word Embeddings:\nWord embeddings are numerical representations of words that capture their semantic meaning. In the context of spam detection, word embeddings can help capture the context and relationships between words. Pre-trained word embeddings, such as GloVe or word2vec, can be utilized to convert the tokens into dense vectors. Alternatively, techniques like one-hot encoding or TF-IDF can be employed to represent the words in a numerical form.\n\n## Padding and Truncation:\nTo ensure that all input sequences have a uniform length, padding, and truncation techniques are applied. Emails with shorter lengths can be padded with zero vectors or a special padding token to match the maximum length. On the other hand, longer emails can be truncated to the maximum allowed length to maintain consistency.\n\n## Cleaning Steps:\n### Filtering:\nFiltering involves removing irrelevant or redundant information from the emails. This can include eliminating stop words (commonly used words with little significance, like \"and,\" \"the,\" etc.) and applying stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base or dictionary form. Additionally, regular expressions can be used to identify and remove URLs, email addresses, or specific patterns that may not contribute to the spam detection task.\n\n### Deduplication:\nDeduplication is essential to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's generalization ability. It involves identifying and removing duplicate emails or highly similar emails from the dataset. This step helps in reducing bias and ensuring that the model learns from a diverse set of examples.\n\n### Privacy Scrubbing:\nPrivacy scrubbing is crucial to protect sensitive information. For emails, this involves identifying and removing personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and other confidential details. Techniques like anonymization, redaction, or tokenization can be employed to replace or mask sensitive information while preserving the structure and context of the emails.\n\n## Additional Preprocessing Techniques:\n### Text Segmentation:\nText segmentation involves dividing the emails into meaningful segments, such as paragraphs, sentences, or even smaller units like clauses or phrases. This step can aid in better understanding the context and structure of the emails, especially if sentence-level or paragraph-level features are to be extracted.\n\n### ML-Based Classification:\nMachine learning techniques can be leveraged to classify emails into relevant categories or topics. This can involve training a classifier on a labeled dataset to identify specific patterns or characteristics associated with spam emails. The classifier can then be used to predict the category of new, unseen emails.\n\n## Conclusion:\nPreprocessing text data for a SpamDetector model requires a combination of tokenization, handling word embeddings, padding and truncation techniques, and various cleaning steps. By applying these techniques, we can transform the raw email data into a format suitable for input to the SpamDetector model, improving its accuracy and performance.\n</div>",

Adhering to privacy standards fosters trust and promotes the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Filtering out toxic and biased text**\n\n*   In the preprocessing steps of language datasets, a critical consideration is the removal of toxic and biased content to ensure the development of fair and unbiased language models. Addressing toxicity and bias is essential for creating LLMs that align with human values and promote responsible use.\n*   This involves implementing robust content moderation techniques, such as employing sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and bias identification algorithms. These algorithms are designed to automatically identify and flag text that exhibits harmful or inappropriate characteristics.\n*   By leveraging these tools, it is possible to systematically identify and filter out text that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, offensive language, or biased viewpoints. This process helps to create more inclusive and equitable training datasets, fostering fairness and reducing the risk of perpetuating harmful biases.",
        "**Text Segmentation**\n\nText segmentation is the process of dividing text into meaningful units. This is a crucial step in NLP, as it prepares the text for further analysis. The segmentation process can be performed at different levels:\n\n*   Paragraph Segmentation: Dividing a document into individual paragraphs, often based on whitespace or specific formatting.\n*   Sentence Segmentation: Breaking a paragraph into individual sentences, typically using punctuation marks as delimiters.\n*   Word Segmentation: Dividing a sentence into individual words, typically using whitespace as a delimiter. This process faces challenges with languages that do not use spaces between words.\n\n**Tokenization**\n\nTokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation. It involves breaking text into small units called tokens. Tokens are the fundamental building blocks for many NLP tasks. Tokenization involves identifying the elementary units within a text, so that the text is easier to process.",
        "**ML-Based Classification**\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are frequently employed in text classification. The general process involves:\n\n1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a set of annotated text documents. This training set contains documents that are already labelled with the correct categories.\n2.  **Annotation:** Each document in the training set is associated with one or more class labels, which serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n3.  **Prediction:** After the model is trained, it can predict the category (or categories) for new, unseen documents.\n4.  **Confidence Measure:** The classifier may provide a confidence measure, indicating the certainty of its prediction.\n5.  **Vector Representation:** A crucial step in preparing the text for a machine learning model is converting the text into a numerical vector representation. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are often used for this purpose."

        "**Pre-training of LLMs**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) heavily rely on unstructured data for pre-training. Pre-training is the process of training a large model on a massive dataset to learn general language representations.\n\n**Self-supervised pre-training:**\n\n*   Pre-training a large language model is typically done in a self-supervised way, meaning it is trained on unlabeled data, which is usually just text scraped from the internet.\n*   There is no need to assign labels to the dataset manually. Instead, the model learns from the inherent structure of the language itself. If there is no explicit supervision in the data, the model creates its own supervised tasks and solves them.\n\nDifferent self-supervised pre-training methods exist:\n\n*   **Autoencoding (MLM - Masked Language Modeling):** Models based on autoencoding, like BERT, consist primarily of an encoder. During training, a certain percentage of the input words are masked. The model's task is to predict the masked words based on the surrounding context. This bi-directional approach allows the model to gain knowledge of the entire context of the sentence.\n*   **Autoregressive (CLM - Causal Language Modeling):** Autoregressive models, such as GPT, consist of a decoder. They predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. This approach is excellent for text generation tasks, as it naturally simulates the process of writing or speaking. The model predicts the masked word from the preceding words only.\n*   **Seq2Seq (Span Corruption):** Seq2Seq models, like T5, use both an encoder and a decoder. In training, random spans of the input text are masked and replaced with a unique sentinel token. The decoder then predicts the masked spans, with the sentinel token preceding the predicted tokens. This approach forces the model to both understand the context and generate text. In summary, seq2seq models both need to understand the context and generate a text.\n\n**Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n\nMLM, used in models like BERT, involves feeding input text with randomly masked tokens into a Transformer encoder. The goal is to predict the masked tokens. As an example, consider the original text sequence \"I\", \"love\", \"this\", \"red\", \"car\". This sequence is prepended with the \"<cls>\" (classification) token, and the token \"love\" is randomly replaced with the \"<mask>\" token. The model then minimizes the cross-entropy loss between the masked token \"love\" and its prediction during pre-training.\n\n**Next Token Prediction (Causal Language Modeling)**\n\nNext Token Prediction involves training a model to predict the next word in a sequence. Any text can be used for this task, requiring only the prediction of the next word. This method is primarily used to train autoregressive models like GPT.\n\n**Span Corruption**\n\nIn Span Corruption, a technique utilized in models like T5, some words in the original text are dropped out and replaced with a unique sentinel token. Words are dropped out independently and uniformly at random. The model is then trained to predict the sentinel tokens to delineate the dropped out text.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal text: Thank you for inviting me to your party last week.\n\nInputs: Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week.\n\nTargets: <X> for inviting <Y> last <Z>",

        "### T5 Pre-training\nT5 is pre-trained using a denoising autoencoder objective called span-corruption. This pre-training task helps the model learn general language understanding and generation skills.\n\nThe span-corruption objective involves masking spans of text (rather than individual tokens) within the input sequence and then training the model to predict those masked spans.\n\n*   **Input Corruption:** Random spans of text in the input are replaced with a special `<extra_id_X>` token (e.g., `<extra_id_0>`, `<extra_id_1>`).\n*   **Original Input:** \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n*   **Corrupted Input:** \"The quick `<extra_id_0>` jumps `<extra_id_1>` dog.\"\n*   **Target Output:** The model is trained to predict the original masked spans in sequential order.\n*   **Target Output:** `<extra_id_0>` brown fox `<extra_id_1>` over the lazy.\n\nThis span-corruption approach forces the model to generate coherent text and learn contextual relationships between tokens. By predicting missing spans, the model learns to understand the relationships between words and phrases.",
        "### Remembering with recurrent networks\n\nThe words in a document are rarely independent of each other. The occurrence of one word often influences or is influenced by the occurrence of other words. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n\n\"The stolen car sped into the arena.\"\n\"The clown car sped into the arena.\"\n\nThe reader's emotional response to these two sentences may differ significantly at the end, even though they share identical adjective, noun, verb, and prepositional phrase construction. The single adjective change early in the sentence profoundly affects the reader's inference about what is happening.\n\nThe goal is to model this relationship—to understand how \"arena\" and even \"sped\" acquire slightly different connotations based on an adjective appearing earlier in the sentence, even if the adjective does not directly modify these words.\n\nIf a model can \"remember\" what just happened the moment before (specifically, what happened at time step *t* when looking at time step *t+1*), it can capture patterns that emerge when certain tokens appear relative to others in a sequence. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allow neural networks to remember past words within a sentence.\n\nA single recurrent neuron in the hidden layer adds a recurrent loop that \"recycles\" the output of the hidden layer at time *t*. The output at time *t* is added to the next input at time *t+1*. This new input is processed by the network at time step *t+1* to create the output for that hidden layer at time *t+1*. That output at *t+1* is then recycled back into the input again at time step *t+2*, and so on.\n\nFigure 8.3 (not provided in text) depicts a Recurrent Neural Net.\n\n<sup>1</sup> In finance, dynamics, and feedback control, this is often called an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive\\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model).\n\nFigure 8.4 (not provided in text) depicts an Unrolled Recurrent Neural Net."

    "final_response": "<div>\nLanguage models have transformed how machines understand and generate human language. At their core, language models employ statistical techniques to predict the next word in a sequence based on vast amounts of training data. This process involves three critical steps: ingesting and processing the training data, utilizing autoencoding and autoregressive modeling techniques, and employing span corruption for enhanced context understanding.\n\n<h2> Ingesting and Processing Training Data </h2>\n\nThe first step is to feed the language model with an extensive corpus of text data. For example, the LLAMA model is trained on \"The Pile,\" a diverse collection of publicly available text sources, including books, web content, and scientific papers, totaling hundreds of billions of tokens. This diverse dataset ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of linguistic patterns and styles.\n\n<h2> Autoencoding and Autoregressive Modeling </h2>\n\nLanguage models employ autoencoding and autoregressive modeling techniques to make predictions. Autoencoding, used in models like BERT, involves masking random words in the input sequence and training the model to predict the masked words based on context. This bidirectional approach allows the model to understand the complete context of a sentence. On the other hand, autoregressive modeling, used in models like GPT, predicts the next word in a sequence based on previous words. This approach simulates the natural process of writing or speaking and is excellent for text generation tasks.\n\n<h2> Span Corruption for Context Understanding </h2>\n\nSpan corruption, a technique used in models like T5, enhances the model's context understanding. In this technique, random spans of words in the input sequence are masked and replaced with sentinel tokens. The model is then trained to predict the masked spans. For example, in the sentence \"Thank you for inviting me to your party last week,\" the corrupted input could be \"Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week,\" and the model would need to predict the missing spans: \"<X> for inviting <Y> last.\" This approach forces the model to generate coherent text and understand the contextual relationships between tokens.\n\n<h2> Predicting the Next Word </h2>\n\nBy combining these techniques and leveraging its vast training data, a language model can predict the next word in a given sequence. It utilizes the statistical patterns it has learned from the training data, the context provided by autoencoding, and the sequential understanding gained through autoregressive modeling. Additionally, span corruption ensures that the model can fill in missing parts of a sentence coherently. This multi-pronged approach enables language models to generate contextually relevant and grammatically correct predictions.\n</div>",

        "**Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models**\n\nThis material is part of Lesson 8, \"Building a Chatbot,\" within the \"Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica\" (Master's Degree Course in Computer Engineering) at DIEM – University of Salerno. The lesson is instructed by Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco.\n\n**Exercise: Developing a Pizzeria Chatbot**\n\nThe primary task is to create a chatbot designed to streamline and enhance the operations of a pizzeria. The chatbot will enable users to interact with the pizzeria through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the following functionalities:\n\n*   **Menu Requests:** Users can ask the chatbot to provide the pizzeria's menu.\n*   **Pizza Orders:** Users can order a pizza, but only one pizza per order is permitted. Beverage ordering is excluded in this simplified version.\n*   **Order Logging:** After an order is confirmed, the chatbot must log essential details including the date of the order, the user's identification (user ID), and the specific type of pizza ordered. This logging function should be implemented using a custom action to provide flexibility and extensibility.\n*   **Web-Based GUI:** The chatbot must be accessible through a web-based GUI for ease of use and broad accessibility.\n\nIt's recommended to begin with a basic \"dummy bot\" to establish the foundational structure, then add functionality incrementally.\n\n**Example Conversation:**\n\nThe following is a sample dialogue demonstrating the expected interaction flow between a user and the chatbot:\n\nUser: Can I have the menu?\n\nBot: What kind of pizza would you like? We have Parenti, Pepperoni, Vegetarian...\n\nUser: Pepperoni\n\nBot: You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\n\nUser: Yes\n\nBot: Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!",
        "Hint: Start with a dummy bot.\n\nExample conversation:\n\nUser: Can I have the menu?\nBot: What kind of pizza would you like? We have Parenti, Pepperoni, Vegetarian...\nUser: Pepperoni\nBot: You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\nUser: Yes\nBot: Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!\n\n**Hints**\n\nStart with a dummy bot:\n\n```bash\nmkdir pizzaBot\ncd pizzaBot\nrasa init --no-prompt\n```\n\nConfigure and run the REST and the Actions servers:\n\n```bash\nrasa run --cors \"*\"\nrasa run actions\n```\n\nUse a Web frontend like:\n\n[https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0)",
        "## Lesson 8 ##\n\n**Exercise: Building a Pizzeria Chatbot**\n\nDevelop a chatbot to assist with pizzeria operations. Users can:\n\n*   Request the pizzeria's menu.\n*   Order a pizza that is available on the menu (just one pizza, no beverage).\n*   Upon order confirmation, the bot will log the date, the user ID, and the kind of ordered pizza (use a custom action).\n*   The bot has a web-based GUI.",

        "### Decoder\nThe decoder is made of a sequence of decoder blocks having the same structure. The original paper used 6 decoder blocks. The decoder blocks, in addition to the same modules used in the encoder block, add an attention module where the keys and values are taken from the encoder’s intermediate representation *z*<sub>1</sub>,…,*z*<sub>*t*</sub>. Also, the self-attention module is slightly modified so as to ensure that the query at position i only uses the values at positions 1,…,i. On top of the last decoder block, the decoder adds an additional linear layer and a softmax activation function, for computing the probability of the next output element *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. Thus, the last layers has a number of neurons corresponding to the cardinality of the output set.\n\nSimilar to the encoder, the decoder consists of a stack of identical decoder blocks. The original Transformer model utilized 6 such blocks. Each decoder block incorporates the same modules as the encoder block (multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, etc.) and also an attention module that attends to the encoder's output *z*<sub>1</sub>,…,*z*<sub>*t*</sub>. The self-attention mechanism within the decoder is modified to prevent the query at position *i* from attending to future positions (1,…,i only), ensuring causality in the output sequence generation. At the top of the stack, a linear layer and softmax function compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary, predicting the next output element *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. The linear layer’s size matches the output vocabulary size.",

        "**FAISS**\n\n### Introduzione\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) è una libreria open-source sviluppata da Facebook AI Research per l'indicizzazione e la ricerca veloce di vettori ad alta dimensione. Il suo obiettivo principale è rendere più efficiente la ricerca della similarità tra vettori, un'operazione cruciale in molte applicazioni di intelligenza artificiale, come il recupero di informazioni, il riconoscimento delle immagini e i sistemi di raccomandazione.\n\n### Perché FAISS è importante?\nNei moderni sistemi di AI, si lavora spesso con enormi dataset di vettori, specialmente nell'ambito del deep learning. La ricerca esatta della similarità in uno spazio vettoriale può essere computazionalmente proibitiva. FAISS fornisce algoritmi e strutture dati ottimizzate per eseguire ricerche approssimate in modo molto più veloce rispetto a un approccio naïve basato su ricerche brute-force.\n\n### Embedding e Similarità nell'NLP\nFAISS lavora principalmente con **embedding**, rappresentazioni vettoriali di oggetti come testi, immagini o segnali audio. Nel contesto del **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, gli embedding sono vettori numerici che catturano la semantica delle parole, frasi o documenti. \n\n#### Generazione degli embedding\nNell'NLP, gli embedding sono generati attraverso modelli di apprendimento automatico come:\n- **Word2Vec**: rappresenta le parole in base al loro contesto, utilizzando tecniche come Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) e Skip-gram.\n- **GloVe**: costruisce embedding sulla base della co-occorrenza delle parole in un grande corpus testuale.\n- **FastText**: un'estensione di Word2Vec che considera anche i sottotokens delle parole, utile per lingue con morfologia complessa.\n- **BERT e Transformer-based models**: generano embedding contestualizzati che variano in base alla frase in cui la parola appare.\n- **Sentence Transformers**: creano embedding per intere frasi, migliorando la ricerca semantica e la similarità testuale.\n\n#### Metriche di Similarità\nUna volta ottenuti gli embedding, FAISS permette di confrontarli utilizzando diverse metriche di similarità:\n- **Similarità coseno**: misura l'angolo tra due vettori e viene ampiamente utilizzata per valutare la similarità semantica tra testi.\n- **Distanza euclidea (L2)**: meno comune nell'NLP, utile quando gli embedding hanno distribuzioni spaziali significative.\n- **Prodotto scalare (dot product)**: spesso usato nei modelli neurali per valutare l'affinità tra vettori.\n\n#### Applicazioni nell'NLP\nFAISS è particolarmente utile in molteplici applicazioni NLP, tra cui:\n- **Recupero di informazioni**: aiuta a trovare documenti o frasi simili in grandi dataset, come nella ricerca semantica.\n- **Risoluzione della coreferenza**: identifica entità simili in un testo, associando riferimenti diversi a uno stesso concetto.\n- **Sistemi di raccomandazione di testi**: suggerisce articoli, post o libri basandosi sulla similarità degli embedding.\n- **Clustering e analisi dei topic**: raggruppa documenti con contenuti simili, utile per la categorizzazione automatica.\n- **Traduzione automatica e allineamento testuale**: confronta frasi in lingue diverse per trovare corrispondenze tra segmenti di testo.\n\n### Creazione e uso di un FAISS Index nell'NLP\nFAISS fornisce API in Python per la gestione efficiente degli embedding testuali. Ecco un esempio per indicizzare e cercare frasi simili:\n\n```python\nimport faiss\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\n# Modello per generare embedding testuali\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n\ndocuments = [\n    \"Il gatto salta sul tavolo\",\n    \"Un felino è balzato sulla superficie\",\n    \"Oggi il tempo è splendido\",\n    \"La partita di calcio è stata emozionante\"\n]\n\n# Creazione degli embedding\nd = 384  # Dimensione del modello MiniLM\nembeddings = np.array(model.encode(documents), dtype='float32')\n\n# Creazione e popolamento dell'indice FAISS\nindex = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\nindex.add(embeddings)\n\n# Query per trovare frasi simili\nquery_text = \"Il micio è saltato sul mobile\"\nquery_embedding = np.array([model.encode(query_text)], dtype='float32')\nk = 2  # Numero di risultati\n\ndistances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k)\n\n# Output dei risultati\nprint(\"Frasi più simili:\")\nfor i in indices[0]:\n    print(documents[i])\n```\n\n### Vantaggi di FAISS nell'NLP\n- **Velocità di ricerca**: consente di trovare frasi simili in dataset di milioni di documenti in pochi millisecondi.\n- **Scalabilità**: supporta grandi volumi di dati, ideale per motori di ricerca semantica e assistenti virtuali.\n- **Flessibilità**: utilizzabile con vari modelli di embedding, adattandosi a diversi casi d'uso.\n\n### Conclusione\nFAISS è un potente strumento per la ricerca di similarità in embedding testuali, rendendo possibili applicazioni avanzate nell'NLP. Grazie alla sua efficienza, è usato in motori di ricerca semantica, chatbot e sistemi di raccomandazione testuale. L'integrazione con modelli come BERT e Sentence Transformers lo rende una scelta eccellente per chi lavora con grandi corpus di testo."

    "final_response": "<div>\nInput embeddings are an essential concept in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. They are a way of representing textual data, specifically words or tokens, as dense vectors in a continuous vector space of lower dimensionality. This process is often referred to as \"embedding\" the input into a semantic space.\n\nThe key idea behind input embeddings is to capture the semantic meaning of words by mapping them to a continuous Euclidean space, where the distances between words reflect their semantic relationships. Words with similar meanings or contexts are placed close together, while dissimilar words are pushed apart. This allows for effective mathematical operations and comparisons between words, enabling a deeper understanding of the text.\n\nThe significance of input embeddings lies in their ability to represent textual data in a way that captures the nuances and complexities of human language. By embedding words into a semantic space, models can go beyond simple keyword recognition and start understanding context, intent, and meaning. This enables a wide range of applications, such as language translation, text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.\n\nInput embeddings are also crucial for Large Language Models, as they provide a compact and efficient representation of the vast vocabulary these models need to process. By using dense vectors with dimensions much smaller than the vocabulary size, models can process and store information more effectively, leading to improved performance and scalability.\n</div>",

        "## Word Embeddings\nWord Embeddings: A technique for representing words with vectors (A.K.A. Word Vectors) that are:\n*   Dense: Unlike one-hot vectors, word embeddings have mostly non-zero elements.\n*   With dimensions much smaller than the vocabulary size: This makes them more efficient to store and process.  Typical dimensions range from 50 to 300.\n*   In a continuous vector space: This allows for mathematical operations to be performed on the vectors, capturing semantic relationships.\n\n**Key feature:** Vectors are generated so that words with similar meanings are close to each other. The position in the space represents the semantics of the word.\n\nWord Embeddings:\n*   king and queen are close to each other: because they both represent royalty.\n*   apple and banana are close to each other: because they are both fruits.\nThe words of the first group are far from those of to the second group: highlighting the semantic distinction between royalty and fruit.\n\n**Example:**\n*   Apple = (0.25,0.16)\n*   Banana = (0.33,0.10)\n*   King = (0.29,0.68)\n*   Queen = (0.51,0.71)\nThis is a simplified illustration with 2D vectors; real word embeddings have much higher dimensionality.",

        "**Topic Labelling Example**\n\n**Classifying Reuters News**\n\nThe Reuters-21578 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for text classification, particularly for topic labeling. Its characteristics are:\n\n*   Multi-class and multi-label: Documents can belong to multiple topics simultaneously.\n*   90 distinct classes: Covering a broad range of news topics.\n*   7,769 training documents, 3,019 test documents: Providing a sufficient amount of data for training and evaluating models.\n*   The number of words per document ranges from 93 to 1,263: Indicating variable document lengths.\n*   Skewness: The distribution of documents across classes is uneven:\n    *   Some classes have over 1,000 documents.\n    *   Other classes have fewer than 5 documents.\n    *   Most documents are assigned either one or two labels, while some documents are labeled with up to 15 categories, adding complexity to the classification task.\n\nFurther statistics about the dataset are available at https://martin-thoma.com/nlp-reuters/.",
        "**Types of Classification**\n\nText classification can be further categorized into different types based on the number of classes a document can be assigned to:\n\n*   **Single-label:** Each document in the dataset D is assigned to only one class from the set of classes C. An example would be assigning a news article to one specific category such as 'sports' or 'politics'.\n\n*   **Binary:** This is a special case of single-label classification where the set of classes C contains only two classes. This simplifies the problem to a decision between a class and its complement (the other class). For example, classifying emails as either 'spam' or 'not spam'.\n\n*   **Multi-label:** In multi-label classification, each document can be assigned to multiple classes from the set C. An example is categorizing a news article into multiple categories such as 'business' and 'finance'. Multi-label classification can be approached by transforming it into a series of binary classification problems, one for each class."

        "**ML-Based Classification**\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are frequently employed in text classification. The general process involves:\n\n1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a set of annotated text documents. This training set contains documents that are already labelled with the correct categories.\n2.  **Annotation:** Each document in the training set is associated with one or more class labels, which serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n3.  **Prediction:** After the model is trained, it can predict the category (or categories) for new, unseen documents.\n4.  **Confidence Measure:** The classifier may provide a confidence measure, indicating the certainty of its prediction.\n5.  **Vector Representation:** A crucial step in preparing the text for a machine learning model is converting the text into a numerical vector representation. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are often used for this purpose."

    "final_response": "<div> Token normalization is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that serves the purpose of transforming tokens into a standard form. This process offers several advantages: it reduces the vocabulary size, making it more manageable for NLP models, and it enhances the accuracy of various NLP tasks by providing a consistent representation of tokens. \n\nTo achieve token normalization, two common techniques are employed: stemming and lemmatization. Stemming focuses on reducing words to their root form by removing prefixes or suffixes. For example, the word \"running\" would be stemmed to \"run.\" On the other hand, lemmatization considers the context and aims to reduce words to their dictionary form, known as the lemma. So, the word \"better\" would be lemmatized to \"good.\" \n\nWhile these techniques are useful, they also come with certain disadvantages. One issue is their inability to effectively group synonyms, as they primarily concentrate on morphological similarities rather than semantic relationships. Additionally, stemming and lemmatization might group words with identical spellings but different meanings (homonyms or polysemes), which can lead to confusion and inaccuracies in text representation. \n\nIn conclusion, token normalization plays a vital role in standardizing tokens, making NLP tasks more efficient and accurate.

        "## Additional Context\n\nHere is further relevant context to the topic covered.\n\nPopular sampling techniques that are often used in practice are top-k sampling and nucleus sampling. We won’t discuss all of them here - you can read more about them in HuggingFace’s excellent guide.\n[\n26\n]\nLet’s try to generate text using nucleus sampling method. In this method, instead of choosing among the K most likely words, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is smaller than p. So if there are only a few candidates with large probabilities, the \"nucleus\" would be smaller, than in the case of larger group of candidates with smaller probabilities. Note that because sampling is probabilistic, the generated text will be different for you - this is not something that can be controlled with a random seed.\n\nListing 10.7 Generating text using nucleus sampling method\n```python\n>>> nucleus_sampling_args = {\n...    'do_sample': True,\n...    'max_length': 50,\n...    'top_p': 0.92\n... }\n>>> print(generate(prompt='NLP is a', **nucleus_sampling_args))\n```\nNLP is a multi-level network protocol, which is one of the most well-documented protocols for managing data transfer protocols. This is useful if one can perform network transfers using one data transfer protocol and another protocol or protocol in the same chain.\nOK. This is better, but still not quite what you were looking for. Your output still uses the same words too much (just count how many times \"protocol\" was mentioned!) But more importantly, though NLP indeed can stand for Network Layer Protocol, it’s not what you were looking for. To get generated text that is domain-specific, you need to fine-tune our model - that means, to train it on a dataset that is specific to our task.\n\n### 10.1.7 Fine-tuning your generative model\nIn your case, this dataset would be this very book, parsed into a database of lines. Let’s load it from nlpia2 repository. In this case, we only need the book’s text, so we’ll ignore code, headers, and all other things that will not be helpful for our generative model.\nLet’s also initialize a new version of our GPT-2 model for finetuning. We can reuse the tokenizer for GPT-2 we initialized before.\n\nListing 10.8 Loading the NLPiA2 lines as training data for GPT-2\n```python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> DATASET_URL = ('https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/'\n...     '-/raw/main/src/nlpia2/data/nlpia_lines.csv')\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_URL)\n>>> df = df[df['is_text']]\n>>> lines = df.line_text.copy()\n```\n\nThis will read all the sentences of natural language text in the manuscript for this book. Each line or sentence will be a different \"document\" in your NLP pipeline, so your model will learn how to generate sentences rather than longer passages. You want to wrap your list of sentences with a PyTorch Dataset class so that your text will be structured in the way that our training pipeline expects.\n\nListing 10.9 Creating a PyTorch Dataset for training\n```python\n>>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n>>> from torch.utils.data import random_split\n>>> class NLPiADataset(Dataset):\n>>>     def __init__(self, txt_list, tokenizer, max_length=768):\n>>>         self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n>>>         self.input_ids = []\n>>>         self.attn_masks = []\n>>>         for txt in txt_list:\n>>>             encodings_dict = tokenizer(txt, truncation=True,\n...                 max_length=max_length, padding=\"max_length\")\n>>>             self.input_ids.append(\n...                 torch.tensor(encodings_dict['input_ids']))\n>>>     def __len__(self):\n>>>         return len(self.input_ids)\n>>>     def __getitem__(self, idx):\n>>>         return self.input_ids[idx]\n```\nNow, we want to set aside some samples for evaluating our loss mid-training. Usually, we would need to wrap them in the DataLoader wrapper, but luckily, the Transformers package simplifies things for us.\n\nListing 10.10 Creating training and evaluation sets for fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> dataset = NLPiADataset(lines, tokenizer, max_length=768)\n>>> train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))\n>>> eval_size = len(dataset) - train_size\n>>> train_dataset, eval_dataset = random_split(\n...     dataset, [train_size, eval_size])\n```\n\nFinally, you need one more Transformers library object - DataCollator. It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```",

        "**Pre-training of LLMs**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) heavily rely on unstructured data for pre-training. Pre-training is the process of training a large model on a massive dataset to learn general language representations.\n\n**Self-supervised pre-training:**\n\n*   Pre-training a large language model is typically done in a self-supervised way, meaning it is trained on unlabeled data, which is usually just text scraped from the internet.\n*   There is no need to assign labels to the dataset manually. Instead, the model learns from the inherent structure of the language itself. If there is no explicit supervision in the data, the model creates its own supervised tasks and solves them.\n\nDifferent self-supervised pre-training methods exist:\n\n*   **Autoencoding (MLM - Masked Language Modeling):** Models based on autoencoding, like BERT, consist primarily of an encoder. During training, a certain percentage of the input words are masked. The model's task is to predict the masked words based on the surrounding context. This bi-directional approach allows the model to gain knowledge of the entire context of the sentence.\n*   **Autoregressive (CLM - Causal Language Modeling):** Autoregressive models, such as GPT, consist of a decoder. They predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. This approach is excellent for text generation tasks, as it naturally simulates the process of writing or speaking. The model predicts the masked word from the preceding words only.\n*   **Seq2Seq (Span Corruption):** Seq2Seq models, like T5, use both an encoder and a decoder. In training, random spans of the input text are masked and replaced with a unique sentinel token. The decoder then predicts the masked spans, with the sentinel token preceding the predicted tokens. This approach forces the model to both understand the context and generate text. In summary, seq2seq models both need to understand the context and generate a text.\n\n**Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n\nMLM, used in models like BERT, involves feeding input text with randomly masked tokens into a Transformer encoder. The goal is to predict the masked tokens. As an example, consider the original text sequence \"I\", \"love\", \"this\", \"red\", \"car\". This sequence is prepended with the \"<cls>\" (classification) token, and the token \"love\" is randomly replaced with the \"<mask>\" token. The model then minimizes the cross-entropy loss between the masked token \"love\" and its prediction during pre-training.\n\n**Next Token Prediction (Causal Language Modeling)**\n\nNext Token Prediction involves training a model to predict the next word in a sequence. Any text can be used for this task, requiring only the prediction of the next word. This method is primarily used to train autoregressive models like GPT.\n\n**Span Corruption**\n\nIn Span Corruption, a technique utilized in models like T5, some words in the original text are dropped out and replaced with a unique sentinel token. Words are dropped out independently and uniformly at random. The model is then trained to predict the sentinel tokens to delineate the dropped out text.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal text: Thank you for inviting me to your party last week.\n\nInputs: Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week.\n\nTargets: <X> for inviting <Y> last <Z>",
        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",

        "**Datasets and data pre-processing**\n\n**Datasets**\n\n*   Training LLMs requires vast amounts of text data, and the quality of this data significantly impacts LLM performance. The quantity and quality of data used to train LLMs are directly correlated to their performance, generalization, and bias.\n*   Pre-training on large-scale corpora provides LLMs with a fundamental understanding of language and some generative capability. Exposure to diverse textual patterns, grammar rules, and semantic relationships allows LLMs to acquire a general understanding of language structure and usage.\n*   Pre-training data sources are diverse, commonly incorporating web text, conversational data, and books as general pre-training corpora. Different data sources contribute unique characteristics and biases to the model, affecting its overall behavior.\n*   Leveraging diverse sources of text data for LLM training can significantly enhance the model’s generalization capabilities.

        "**Summary on pre-training**\n\n*   Pre-training tasks can be invented flexibly, and effective representations can be derived from a flexible regime of pre-training tasks. The ability to design different pre-training objectives allows researchers to tailor the model to specific downstream tasks or to explore different aspects of language understanding.\n*   Different NLP tasks seem to be highly transferable, producing effective representations that form a general model, which can serve as the backbone for many specialized models. This transferability is a key benefit of pre-training, allowing models to be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal task-specific training.\n*   With Self-Supervised Learning, the models seem to be able to learn from generating the language itself, rather than from any specific task. Self-supervised learning enables models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data, unlocking the potential to capture intricate patterns and relationships in language.\n*   Language Model can be used as a Knowledge Base, namely a generatively pre-trained model may have a decent zero-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks. The knowledge acquired during pre-training can be surprisingly effective, enabling the model to perform reasonably well on tasks without any explicit fine-tuning."

    "final_response": "<div>\nPre-training is a fundamental step in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) as it serves multiple purposes. Firstly, pre-training allows LLMs to acquire a broad understanding of language and its structure. By being exposed to massive amounts of unlabeled text data, LLMs learn the inherent patterns, grammar rules, and semantic relationships that exist within language. This foundational knowledge enables them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\n\nSecondly, pre-training reduces the need for extensive task-specific feature engineering. In the traditional NLP paradigm, feature engineering was a time-consuming and iterative process that required deep domain knowledge. With pre-training, LLMs can leverage their vast knowledge to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This flexibility enables LLMs to perform well on a diverse range of tasks, even those they were not explicitly trained for.\n\nAdditionally, pre-training enables zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities in LLMs. Zero-shot learning refers to the ability to perform tasks without any task-specific training examples, while few-shot learning involves providing only a small number of examples. Pre-training equips LLMs with a rich understanding of language, allowing them to generalize and extrapolate from their existing knowledge to tackle new tasks effectively.\n\nMoreover, pre-training contributes to the interpretability and explainability of LLMs. As these models become increasingly complex, understanding their decision-making processes is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases. By analyzing the pre-training process and the knowledge acquired during this phase, researchers can gain insights into how LLMs arrive at their conclusions.\n\nIn summary, pre-training is essential for LLMs because it provides them with a solid language foundation, reduces the need for feature engineering, enables zero-shot and few-shot learning, and enhances interpretability. This step allows LLMs to become versatile, adaptable, and capable of generating meaningful responses across a wide range of tasks and domains.\n</div>",

        "**Pre-training of LLMs**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) heavily rely on unstructured data for pre-training. Pre-training is the process of training a large model on a massive dataset to learn general language representations.\n\n**Self-supervised pre-training:**\n\n*   Pre-training a large language model is typically done in a self-supervised way, meaning it is trained on unlabeled data, which is usually just text scraped from the internet.\n*   There is no need to assign labels to the dataset manually. Instead, the model learns from the inherent structure of the language itself. If there is no explicit supervision in the data, the model creates its own supervised tasks and solves them.\n\nDifferent self-supervised pre-training methods exist:\n\n*   **Autoencoding (MLM - Masked Language Modeling):** Models based on autoencoding, like BERT, consist primarily of an encoder. During training, a certain percentage of the input words are masked. The model's task is to predict the masked words based on the surrounding context. This bi-directional approach allows the model to gain knowledge of the entire context of the sentence.\n*   **Autoregressive (CLM - Causal Language Modeling):** Autoregressive models, such as GPT, consist of a decoder. They predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. This approach is excellent for text generation tasks, as it naturally simulates the process of writing or speaking. The model predicts the masked word from the preceding words only.\n*   **Seq2Seq (Span Corruption):** Seq2Seq models, like T5, use both an encoder and a decoder. In training, random spans of the input text are masked and replaced with a unique sentinel token. The decoder then predicts the masked spans, with the sentinel token preceding the predicted tokens. This approach forces the model to both understand the context and generate text. In summary, seq2seq models both need to understand the context and generate a text.\n\n**Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n\nMLM, used in models like BERT, involves feeding input text with randomly masked tokens into a Transformer encoder. The goal is to predict the masked tokens. As an example, consider the original text sequence \"I\", \"love\", \"this\", \"red\", \"car\". This sequence is prepended with the \"<cls>\" (classification) token, and the token \"love\" is randomly replaced with the \"<mask>\" token. The model then minimizes the cross-entropy loss between the masked token \"love\" and its prediction during pre-training.\n\n**Next Token Prediction (Causal Language Modeling)**\n\nNext Token Prediction involves training a model to predict the next word in a sequence. Any text can be used for this task, requiring only the prediction of the next word. This method is primarily used to train autoregressive models like GPT.\n\n**Span Corruption**\n\nIn Span Corruption, a technique utilized in models like T5, some words in the original text are dropped out and replaced with a unique sentinel token. Words are dropped out independently and uniformly at random. The model is then trained to predict the sentinel tokens to delineate the dropped out text.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal text: Thank you for inviting me to your party last week.\n\nInputs: Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week.\n\nTargets: <X> for inviting <Y> last <Z>",

        "**Summary on pre-training**\n\n*   Pre-training tasks can be invented flexibly, and effective representations can be derived from a flexible regime of pre-training tasks. The ability to design different pre-training objectives allows researchers to tailor the model to specific downstream tasks or to explore different aspects of language understanding.\n*   Different NLP tasks seem to be highly transferable, producing effective representations that form a general model, which can serve as the backbone for many specialized models. This transferability is a key benefit of pre-training, allowing models to be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal task-specific training.\n*   With Self-Supervised Learning, the models seem to be able to learn from generating the language itself, rather than from any specific task. Self-supervised learning enables models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data, unlocking the potential to capture intricate patterns and relationships in language.\n*   Language Model can be used as a Knowledge Base, namely a generatively pre-trained model may have a decent zero-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks. The knowledge acquired during pre-training can be surprisingly effective, enabling the model to perform reasonably well on tasks without any explicit fine-tuning."

        "12.5.1 Building an intent-based chatbot with Rasa\nRasa is an open-source conversational framework that started back in 2016\nand today is used to create thousands of bots in various languages around the\nworld. Unlike many commercial frameworks, that create a drag-and-drop\ninterface to create the dialog trees we discussed in the previous section,\nRASA took a radically different approach to organizing multi-step\nconversations.\nThe basic units of a conversation in RASA are a user intent and a bot action -\nwhich can be as simple as a pre-programmed utterance or a complex action\nprogrammed in Python that results in interaction with other systems - such as\nsaving or retrieving data from a database, or invoking a Web API. By\nchaining these building blocks into sequences - called Stories - RASA allows\nyou to pre-program dialog scenarios in a streamlined way. All this\ninformation is stored in YAML files (YAML stands for Yet Another Markup\nLanguage), each type of components in its own file.\nBut enough with the theoretical explanation - let’s get your hands dirty and\nbuild your first RASA chatbot. First, let’s decide what dialog we want to\nimplement - based on our conversation diagram for the math tutor bot, let’s\nimplement the following short dialog:\nUSER: Hello\nBOT: Well, hello there. Thanks for checking out Rori, a math tutor chatbot. Chatting with Rori helps students improve their math skills. And it's fun too!\nBOT: Are you a parent (or guardian) or are you a student?\nUSER: I'm a parent.\nBOT: For your child to use Rori, we need permission from the parent or guardian. Do you agree to give your child permission to chat with Rori on this Whatsapp number?\nUSER: I agree\nBOT: Thank you for giving permission for your child to chat with Rori.\nWhen your child is ready to start, please give them this phone and have them type \"ready\".\nTo create your bot, you will need to install \nrasa\n package (if you’re working\nin \nnlpia2\n environment, it is already installed when you install the project).\nThen, you can go to the directory you want to create the project in and run in\nyour command line:\n$ rasa init\nThe installation wizard will guide you through creating a new project and\neven offer you to train an initial model. Let it do that, and then you can even\nchat with a simple chatbot the wizard initialized for you.\nLet’s now dive into the structure of our project and understand how to build a\ndialog like you’ve just had. Here is the directory structure you should see in\nthe project’s folder:\n├───.rasa\n│   └───cache\n│       ├───...\n├───actions\n│   └───__pycache__\n├───data\n├───models\n└───tests\nThe directory we are most interested in is the \ndata\n directory. It contains the\nfiles that define the data that is used to train the chatbot’s NLU model. First,\nthere’s the \nnlu.yml\n file, which contains the intents and examples of user\nutterances that are used to train the intent recognition model. So let’s start\ncreating the intents that are used in our dialog. For every intent you want to\ndefine, you need to provide a name and a list of examples of utterances that\nbelong to this intent.\nFor our short dialog, we need to understand the user’s greeting, their role\n(parent or student), and their agreement to give permission to their child to\nuse the chatbot.\nversion\n: \n\"\n3.1\n\"\nnlu\n:\n- \nintent: greet\n  \nexamples\n: \n|\n - hey - hello - hi\n- \nintent: parent\n - I am a parent - Parent - I'm a mom to 12 year old\n- \nintent: agree\n...\nPretty straightforward, right? RASA will warn if you have too few examples\nfor a particular intent, and recommends at least 7-10 utterance examples per\nintent.\nThe next file you should look at is \ndomain.yml\naccount. When text message chatbots came onto the scene most continued to\nfollow this dark pattern of non-cooperative conversation, trying your patience\nand preventing you from creating cost for the business. The more advanced\nNLP skills you have learned in this book now give you the power to build\nchatbots that can simulate intelligent conversation and do useful work for you\nand your organization.\nThe chatbot boom is not over yet. You are about to learn all the ways they\ncan be used to improve your life or your business."

        "**Additional Context:**\n\nThis section includes additional context gleaned from a practical example of using the base PyTorch implementation of the Transformer module to implement a language translation model. In a language translation model, self-attention enables a leap forward in capability for problems where LSTMs struggled, such as: Conversation — Generate plausible responses to conversational prompts, queries, or utterances.\nAbstractive summarization or paraphrasing\n:: Generate a new shorter wording of a long text summarization of sentences, paragraphs, and\neven several pages of text.\nOpen domain question answering\n:: Answering a general question about\nanything the transformer has ever read.\nReading comprehension question answering\n:: Answering questions\nabout a short body of text (usually less than a page).\nEncoding\n:: A single vector or sequence of embedding vectors that\nrepresent the meaning of body of text in a vector space — sometimes\ncalled task-independent sentence embedding\n.\nTranslation and code generation\n — Generating plausible software\nexpressions and programs based on plain English descriptions of the\nprogram’s purpose.\nThere are two ways to implement the linear algebra of an attention algorithm: additive attention or dot-product attention. The one that was most effective in transformers is a scaled version of dot-production attention. For dot-product attention, the scalar products between the query vectors Q and the key vectors K, are scaled down based on how many dimensions there are in the model.\nThis makes the dot product more numerically stable for large dimensional embeddings and longer text sequences. For dot-product attention, the scalar products between the query vectors Q and the key vectors K, are scaled down based on how many dimensions there are in the model.\nThis makes the dot product more numerically stable for large dimensional embeddings and longer text sequences.\nUnlike RNNs, where there is recurrence and shared weights, in self-attention all of the vectors used in the query, key, and value matrices come from the input sequences' embedding vectors. The entire mechanism can be\nimplemented with highly optimized matrix multiplication operations. And the Q\n \nK product forms a square matrix that can be understood as the connection\nbetween words in the input sequence.\nMulti-head self-attention is an expansion of the self-attention approach to\ncreating multiple attention heads that each attend to different aspects of the\nwords in a text. So if a token has multiple meanings that are all relevant to the\ninterpretation of the input text, they can each be accounted for in the separate\nattention heads. You can think of each attention head as another dimension of\nthe encoding vector for a body of text, similar to the additional dimensions of\nan embedding vector for an individual token .\n\nThe multiple heads allow the model to focus on different positions, not just\nones centered on a single word. This effectively creates several different vector subspaces where the transformer can encode a particular generalization for a subset of the word patterns in your text. In the original transformers paper, the model uses n\n=8 attention heads such that \\(d_k = d_v\n= \\frac{d_{model}}{n} = 64\\). The reduced dimensionality in the multi-head\nsetup is to ensure the computation and concatenation cost is nearly equivalent\nto the size of a full-dimensional single-attention head.\n\nThe attention matrices (attention heads) created by the product of Q and K all have the same shape, and they are all square (same number of rows as columns). This means that the attention matrix merely rotates the input sequence of embeddings into a new sequence of embeddings, without affecting the shape or magnitude of the embeddings.\nEncoder-decoders based on RNNs don’t work very well for longer passages of text\nwhere related word patterns are far apart. Even long sentences are a challenge\nfor RNNs doing translation. And the attention mechanism compensates for\nthis by allowing a language model to pick up important concepts at the\nbeginning of a text and connect them to text that is towards the end. The\nattention mechanism gives the transformer a way to reach back to any word it\nhas ever seen. Unfortunately, adding the attention mechanism forces you to\nremove all recurrence from the transformer.\n\nThe loss of recurrence in a transformer creates a new challenge because the\ntransformer operates on the entire sequence all at once. A transformer is\nreading the entire token sequence all at once. And it outputs the tokens all at\nonce as well, making bi-directional transformers an obvious approach.\nTransformers do not care about the normal causal order of tokens while it is\nreading or writing text. To give transformers information about the causal\nsequence of tokens, positional encoding was added.\nThe combination of BPE plus attention plus positional encoding combine together to create unprecedented scalability. These three innovations and simplifications of neural networks combined to create a\nnetwork that is both much more stackable and much more parallelizable.\nStackability\n:: The inputs and outputs of a transformer layer have the\nexact same structure so they can be stacked to increase capacity\nParallelizability\n:: The cookie cutter transformer layers all rely heavily\non large matrix multiplications rather than complex recurrence and\nlogical switching gates. The increased intelligence that\ntransformers bring to AI is transforming culture, society, and the economy.\nFor the first time, transformers are making us question the long-term\neconomic value of human intelligence and creativity.\nThe attention matrix enables a transformer to accurately model the connections\nbetween all the words in a long body of text, all at once.\n\nAnd the attention matrix within each layer spans the entire length of the input\ntext, so each transformer layer has the same internal structure and math. You\ncan stack as many transformer encoder and decoder layers as you like\ncreating as deep a neural network as you need for the information content of\nyour data. Every transformer layer outputs a consistent encoding with the same size and shape."

    "final_response": "<div>\nThe fundamental difference between bidirectional and unidirectional self-attention in Transformers lies in the way they process input sequences. In bidirectional self-attention, also known as \"encoder-only\" Transformers, the model processes the entire input sequence in parallel, allowing each element to attend to all other elements, including those before and after it in the sequence. This enables the model to capture relationships and dependencies across the entire sequence, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the context.\n\nOn the other hand, unidirectional self-attention, commonly found in \"decoder-only\" Transformers, processes the input sequence sequentially, attending to tokens one by one. This approach ensures that the model only considers past tokens when generating the output, maintaining the causal order of the sequence. Unidirectional self-attention is often used in tasks such as text generation, where the model needs to generate tokens based on the preceding context without looking ahead.\n\nThe choice between bidirectional and unidirectional self-attention depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. Bidirectional self-attention is suitable for tasks that benefit from understanding the complete context, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. In contrast, unidirectional self-attention is preferred for tasks that involve sequential generation, like language modeling or machine translation, where maintaining the temporal order of tokens is crucial.\n</div>",

The chatbot's knowledge domain extends beyond the specific topics covered in class to include general course information. Examples include identifying course teachers, recommending textbooks, and providing other relevant details regarding the course structure and administration.\n\nA critical requirement is that the chatbot must **exclusively** address questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM course. It must accurately identify and reject out-of-context queries, responding appropriately that it is not authorized to provide information outside the designated scope. This capability ensures that the chatbot remains a focused and reliable resource for course-related inquiries.\n\nProject deliverables include:\n\n*   **Chatbot Code:** The complete source code of the implemented chatbot.\n*   **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the chatbot solution. The report should offer a detailed explanation of the chosen architecture, algorithms, and any specific techniques used to achieve the project goals.\n\n`",
        "`\n\n**Chatbot Evaluation Procedure (In-Depth):**\n\nThe evaluation of the chatbots will consist of two phases, both conducted in real-time during the project discussion. The course instructors will directly interact with each group's chatbot by posing a set of predefined questions.\n\n**Phase 1: Core Performance Evaluation**\n\nThe initial evaluation will assess the chatbot's core capabilities using the following metrics:\n\n*   **Relevance:** This criterion evaluates whether the chatbot's generated text effectively answers the user's query. Does the response directly address the question and provide the needed information?\n*   **Fluency:** This metric assesses the readability and grammatical correctness of the chatbot's output. The generated text should be natural, well-structured, and free of grammatical errors.\n*   **Coherence:** This evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the chatbot's responses. The text should be internally consistent, and the sequence of statements should form a coherent whole.\n\n**Phase 2: Robustness and Precision Assessment**\n\nThe second evaluation phase aims to test the chatbot's ability to handle challenging or ambiguous inputs and maintain accuracy:\n\n*   **Robustness:** This criterion assesses the chatbot's resilience to adversarial or misleading prompts. It tests the chatbot's ability to avoid being misled by prompts designed to trick or confuse it (e.g., questions containing statements like \"Are you sure?\"). The chatbot should maintain accuracy and avoid generating inappropriate responses, even when confronted with manipulative prompts.\n*   **Precision:** This evaluates the chatbot's ability to distinguish between in-context and out-of-context questions. Can the chatbot accurately identify and reject questions unrelated to the NLP and LLM course (e.g., \"Who is the king of Spain?\")?\n\nBased on the chatbot's performance across these aspects, the course instructors will assign a grade that reflects its overall quality and effectiveness. The grade will be determined holistically, considering the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in each evaluation category.",

They are encouraged to utilize any methods covered during the course. This includes both state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and traditional NLP techniques.\n\nA blended approach is also acceptable, where some chatbot components are developed using LLMs, while others rely on more conventional NLP tools. Students can freely explore this hybrid approach, provided they thoroughly justify their choices and design decisions in the final report. The goal is to encourage thoughtful selection and integration of the most suitable tools for each specific task.\n\nExisting LLMs or other pre-trained models can be used, either with or without modifications. However, groups must demonstrate a thorough understanding of *all* tools and models incorporated into their chatbot. Students should be prepared to answer questions regarding every aspect of the code and models used, demonstrating their expertise in the technologies employed. This requirement ensures that students not only use the tools effectively but also gain a deep understanding of their inner workings.\n\n`",

        "**Contextual Enrichment: The Role of Chatbot Frameworks and LLMs**\n\nThe exercise of creating a pizzeria chatbot highlights practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of chatbot frameworks. Building functional and engaging chatbots requires careful consideration of several factors, including the user's intent, the bot's responses, and the overall conversational flow.\n\nChatbot frameworks are designed to abstract away many of the complexities involved in creating a dialog engine, allowing developers to focus on designing the bot's behavior in a domain-specific language.\n\nAs the included context emphasizes, teachers inspire students using feedback on how well the student understands the material. They also think up new ideas as students pose interesting new questions. Students' needs are diverse and dynamic. Due to this fact, hybrid chatbots integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a better method for creating production chatbots in all domains. LLMs are proficient and convincing in their ability to converse with users on virtually any topic. However, the key is to control this power intelligently to prevent misleading or harmful interactions."

The chatbot's knowledge domain extends beyond the specific topics covered in class to include general course information. Examples include identifying course teachers, recommending textbooks, and providing other relevant details regarding the course structure and administration.\n\nA critical requirement is that the chatbot must **exclusively** address questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM course. It must accurately identify and reject out-of-context queries, responding appropriately that it is not authorized to provide information outside the designated scope. This capability ensures that the chatbot remains a focused and reliable resource for course-related inquiries.\n\nProject deliverables include:\n\n*   **Chatbot Code:** The complete source code of the implemented chatbot.\n*   **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the chatbot solution. The report should offer a detailed explanation of the chosen architecture, algorithms, and any specific techniques used to achieve the project goals.\n\n`",
        "`\n\n**Chatbot Evaluation Procedure (In-Depth):**\n\nThe evaluation of the chatbots will consist of two phases, both conducted in real-time during the project discussion. The course instructors will directly interact with each group's chatbot by posing a set of predefined questions.\n\n**Phase 1: Core Performance Evaluation**\n\nThe initial evaluation will assess the chatbot's core capabilities using the following metrics:\n\n*   **Relevance:** This criterion evaluates whether the chatbot's generated text effectively answers the user's query. Does the response directly address the question and provide the needed information?\n*   **Fluency:** This metric assesses the readability and grammatical correctness of the chatbot's output. The generated text should be natural, well-structured, and free of grammatical errors.\n*   **Coherence:** This evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the chatbot's responses. The text should be internally consistent, and the sequence of statements should form a coherent whole.\n\n**Phase 2: Robustness and Precision Assessment**\n\nThe second evaluation phase aims to test the chatbot's ability to handle challenging or ambiguous inputs and maintain accuracy:\n\n*   **Robustness:** This criterion assesses the chatbot's resilience to adversarial or misleading prompts. It tests the chatbot's ability to avoid being misled by prompts designed to trick or confuse it (e.g., questions containing statements like \"Are you sure?\"). The chatbot should maintain accuracy and avoid generating inappropriate responses, even when confronted with manipulative prompts.\n*   **Precision:** This evaluates the chatbot's ability to distinguish between in-context and out-of-context questions. Can the chatbot accurately identify and reject questions unrelated to the NLP and LLM course (e.g., \"Who is the king of Spain?\")?\n\nBased on the chatbot's performance across these aspects, the course instructors will assign a grade that reflects its overall quality and effectiveness. The grade will be determined holistically, considering the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in each evaluation category.",
        "**Contextual Enrichment: The Role of Chatbot Frameworks and LLMs**\n\nThe exercise of creating a pizzeria chatbot highlights practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of chatbot frameworks. Building functional and engaging chatbots requires careful consideration of several factors, including the user's intent, the bot's responses, and the overall conversational flow.\n\nChatbot frameworks are designed to abstract away many of the complexities involved in creating a dialog engine, allowing developers to focus on designing the bot's behavior in a domain-specific language.\n\nAs the included context emphasizes, teachers inspire students using feedback on how well the student understands the material. They also think up new ideas as students pose interesting new questions. Students' needs are diverse and dynamic. Due to this fact, hybrid chatbots integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a better method for creating production chatbots in all domains. LLMs are proficient and convincing in their ability to converse with users on virtually any topic. However, the key is to control this power intelligently to prevent misleading or harmful interactions.",
        "`\n\n**Tools to Use for the Project (Expanded):**\n\nStudents have significant flexibility in selecting the tools and technologies for this project. They are encouraged to utilize any methods covered during the course. This includes both state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and traditional NLP techniques.\n\nA blended approach is also acceptable, where some chatbot components are developed using LLMs, while others rely on more conventional NLP tools. Students can freely explore this hybrid approach, provided they thoroughly justify their choices and design decisions in the final report. The goal is to encourage thoughtful selection and integration of the most suitable tools for each specific task.\n\nExisting LLMs or other pre-trained models can be used, either with or without modifications. However, groups must demonstrate a thorough understanding of *all* tools and models incorporated into their chatbot. Students should be prepared to answer questions regarding every aspect of the code and models used, demonstrating their expertise in the technologies employed. This requirement ensures that students not only use the tools effectively but also gain a deep understanding of their inner workings.\n\n`",
        "12.1.1 Different chatbots, same tools\nAs diverse as the chatbot examples in this section seem to be, they all\nleverage the same NLP tools and techniques that you have learned in this\nbook. All the previous chapters have been building up your skills and toolbox\nso you can assemble a chatbot.

While the majority of the pre-trained weights remain unchanged, specific portions of the model are updated during fine-tuning to adapt BERT to the specific downstream task.\n\nIn BERT's architecture, the Transformer layers form the core of the model. These layers capture the contextual relationships between words in a sentence.

This means that the core language understanding capabilities acquired during pre-training remain intact.\n\nHowever, there are additional layers added during fine-tuning, which are specific to the downstream task. For example, in text classification tasks, a single linear layer might be added on top of the final hidden state of the [CLS] token to predict the class labels. In named entity recognition (NER) tasks, additional layers could be inserted to predict the entity labels for each token.\n\nThese task-specific layers are trained from scratch during fine-tuning, and their weights are adjusted based on the specific task's objectives.

        "## Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT)\n\n### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n\n*   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a strategy developed to fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models, such as LLMs, in a computationally efficient manner while requiring fewer learnable parameters compared to standard fine-tuning methods.\n*   PEFT methods are especially important in the context of LLMs due to their massive size, which makes full fine-tuning computationally expensive and storage-intensive.\n*   PEFT is ideal for resource-constrained settings like edge devices or applications with frequent model updates.\n*   These techniques are supported and implemented in Hugging Face transformers and, in particular, in the `peft` library.\n\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a suite of techniques designed to reduce the computational burden of fine-tuning large pre-trained models like LLMs. PEFT achieves this by updating a significantly smaller number of parameters compared to full fine-tuning. This efficiency is particularly valuable for LLMs because their vast size makes full fine-tuning computationally demanding and requires significant storage capacity. PEFT methods are well-suited for resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices (e.g., smartphones, embedded systems) or applications that require frequent model updates. The Hugging Face `transformers` library, particularly the `peft` library, provides robust support and implementations of these techniques, making them readily accessible to researchers and practitioners.",
        "### PEFT techniques\n\n*   Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Approximates weight updates by learning low-rank matrices, performing a small parameterized update of the weight matrices in the LLM. It is highly parameter-efficient and widely adopted for adapting LLMs.\n*   Adapters: They are small and trainable modules inserted within the transformer layers of the LLM, that allow to keep the pre-trained model's original weights frozen.\n*   Prefix Tuning: Learns a set of continuous task-specific prefix vectors for attention layers, keeping the original model parameters frozen.\n\nSeveral techniques fall under the umbrella of PEFT. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method that approximates the weight updates required for fine-tuning by learning low-rank matrices. Instead of directly modifying the original weight matrices, LoRA performs a small, parameterized update, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Adapters are small, trainable modules inserted within the transformer layers of the LLM. These modules are trained for the specific task, while the original pre-trained model's weights remain frozen, preserving the model's general knowledge. Prefix Tuning involves learning a set of continuous, task-specific prefix vectors that are prepended to the input sequence. These prefixes influence the attention mechanism of the LLM, guiding its output generation towards the desired task, all while keeping the original model parameters frozen.",
        "### Other types of fine tuning\n\n*   Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Updates only a subset of the parameters.\n    *   Examples: LoRA, Adapters.\n*   Instruction Fine-Tuning: Used to align models with task instructions or prompts (user queries) enhancing usability in real-world applications.\n*   Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning, rewarding models when they generate user-aligned outputs.\n\nBeyond full fine-tuning, other techniques aim to address the computational cost and overfitting risks associated with updating all model parameters. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) focuses on updating only a carefully selected subset of the model's parameters. Examples include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Adapters, which allow adaptation with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Instruction fine-tuning is geared towards aligning models with specific task instructions or prompts, effectively teaching the model to better understand and respond to user queries, which significantly enhances its usability in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning.

    "final_response": "<div>\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) offers a promising approach to enhancing sentiment analysis in specialized fields. Here are some specific ways in which RLHF can improve sentiment analysis tasks:\n\n- **Domain-Specific Language and Jargon:** Specialized fields often have their own unique language, jargon, and terminology. By incorporating feedback from human evaluators with domain expertise, RLHF can help the sentiment analysis model understand and interpret domain-specific language more accurately. This is particularly useful in fields like finance, healthcare, or legal, where industry-specific terminology carries significant weight in sentiment analysis.\n\n- **Contextual Understanding:** Sentiment analysis can be nuanced, and understanding the context is crucial. RLHF can improve the model's ability to capture contextual nuances by providing feedback on the appropriateness of the sentiment prediction given the surrounding context. This is especially beneficial in fields where sentiment can be conveyed indirectly or subtly, such as in literary analysis or social science research.\n\n- **Subjectivity and Inter-Annotator Agreement:** Sentiment analysis is inherently subjective, and different human evaluators may have varying interpretations of the same text. RLHF can address this challenge by aggregating feedback from multiple evaluators and incorporating methods to handle inter-annotator disagreement. This helps the model learn to make more consistent and reliable sentiment predictions, reducing the impact of individual biases.\n\n- **Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis:** RLHF can enable more nuanced sentiment analysis by providing feedback on the intensity or degree of sentiment expressed in a text. This is valuable in fields where understanding the strength of sentiment is important, such as in marketing or customer feedback analysis. The model can learn to distinguish between mildly positive, neutral, and strongly negative sentiments, for example.\n\n- **Domain Adaptation:** When applying sentiment analysis models to new domains or datasets, RLHF can facilitate faster adaptation and improve performance. Human feedback can guide the model to align with the specific characteristics and sentiment expressions unique to the target domain, enhancing its accuracy and generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Handling Negations and Sentiment Shifts:** Sentiment analysis models often struggle with negations and sentiment shifts within a sentence or paragraph. RLHF can be used to specifically address these challenges by providing feedback on the model's handling of negations and sentiment changes. This helps the model learn to accurately interpret and predict sentiment in more complex and nuanced scenarios.\n\nBy leveraging RLHF, sentiment analysis models can become more accurate, adaptable, and aligned with human interpretations in specialized fields.\n</div>",

        "different approaches; we show you techniques for both.\n\nIn addition, deep learning and data-driven programming (machine learning, or probabilistic language modeling) have rapidly diversified the possible applications for NLP and chatbots. This data-driven approach allows ever greater sophistication for an NLP pipeline by providing it with greater and greater amounts of data in the domain you want to apply it to. And when a new machine learning approach is discovered that makes even better use of this data, with more efficient model generalization or regularization, then large jumps in capability are possible.\n\nThe NLP pipeline for a chatbot shown in Figure 1.4 contains all the building blocks for most of the NLP applications that we described at the start of this chapter. As in Taming Text, we break out our pipeline into four main subsystems or stages. In addition, we have explicitly called out a database to record data required for each of these stages and persist their configuration and training sets over time. This can enable batch or online retraining of each of the stages as the chatbot interacts with the world. We have also shown a \"feedback loop\" on our generated text responses so that our responses can be processed using the same algorithms used to process the user statements. The response \"scores\" or features can then be combined in an objective function to evaluate and select the best possible response, depending on the chatbot’s plan or goals for the dialog. This book is focused on configuring this NLP pipeline for a chatbot, but you may also be able to see the analogy to the NLP problem of text retrieval or \"search,\" perhaps the most common NLP application. And our chatbot pipeline is certainly appropriate for the question-answering application that was the focus of Taming Text.\n\nThe application of this pipeline to financial forecasting or business analytics may not be so obvious. But imagine the features generated by the analysis portion of your pipeline. These features of your analysis or feature generation can be optimized for your particular finance or business prediction. That way they can help you incorporate natural language data into a machine learning pipeline for forecasting. Despite focusing on building a chatbot, this book gives you the tools you need for a broad range of NLP applications, from search to financial forecasting.\n\nOne processing element in Figure 1.4 that is not typically employed in search, forecasting, or question-answering systems is natural language generation. For chatbots, this is their central feature. Nonetheless, the text generation step is often incorporated into a search engine NLP application and can give such an engine a large competitive advantage. The ability to consolidate or summarize search results is a winning feature for many popular search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google). And you can imagine how valuable it is for a financial forecasting engine to be able to generate statements, tweets, or entire articles based on the business-actionable events it detects in natural language streams from social media networks and news feeds.\n\nThe next section shows how the layers of such a system can be combined to create greater sophistication and capability at each stage of the NLP pipeline.\n\n### 1.10 Processing in depth\nThe stages of a natural language processing pipeline can be thought of as layers, like the layers in a feed-forward neural network. Deep learning is all about creating more complex models and behavior by adding additional processing layers to the conventional two-layer machine learning model architecture of feature extraction followed by modeling. In Chapter 5 we explain how neural networks help spread the learning across layers by backpropagating model errors from the output layers back to the input layers. But here we talk about the top layers and what can be done by training each layer independently of the other layers.\n\nFigure 1.8 Example layers for an NLP pipeline\nThe top four layers in Figure 1.8 correspond to the first two stages in the chatbot pipeline (feature extraction and feature analysis) in the previous section. For example, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging), is one way to generate features within the Analyze stage of our chatbot pipeline. POS tags are generated automatically by the default SpaCY pipeline, which includes all the top four layers in this diagram. POS tagging is typically accomplished with a finite state transducer like the methods in the nltk.tag package.\n\nThe bottom two layers (Entity Relationships and a Knowledge Base) are used to populate a database containing information (knowledge) about a particular domain. And the information extracted from a particular statement or document using all six of these layers can then be used in combination with that database to make inferences. Inferences are logical extrapolations from a set of conditions detected in the environment, like the logic contained in the statement of a chatbot user. This kind of \"inference engine\" in the deeper layers of this diagram is considered the domain of artificial intelligence, where machines can make inferences about their world and use those inferences to make logical decisions. However, chatbots can make reasonable decisions without this knowledge database, using only the algorithms of the upper few layers. And these decisions can combine to produce surprisingly human-like behaviors.\n\nOver the next few chapters, we dive down through the top few layers of NLP. The top three layers are all that is required to perform meaningful sentiment analysis and semantic search and to build human-mimicking chatbots. In fact, it’s possible to build a useful and interesting chatbot using only a single layer of processing, using the text (character sequences) directly as the features for a language model. A chatbot that only does string matching and search is capable of participating in a reasonably convincing conversation if given enough example statements and responses.\n\nFor example, the open source project ChatterBot simplifies this pipeline by merely computing the string \"edit distance\" (Levenshtein distance) between an input statement and the statements recorded in its database. If its database of statement-response pairs contains a matching statement, the corresponding reply (from a previously \"learned\" human or machine dialog) can be reused as the reply to the latest user statement. For this pipeline, all that is required is step 3 (Generate) of our chatbot pipeline. And within this stage, only a brute-force search algorithm is required to find the best response. With this simple technique (no tokenization or feature generation required), ChatterBot can maintain a convincing conversion as the dialog engine for Salvius, a mechanical robot built from salvaged parts by Gunther Cox.\n[\n65\n]\nWill is an open source Python chatbot framework by Steven Skoczen with a completely different approach.\n[\n66\n]\nWill can only be trained to respond to statements by programming it with regular expressions. This is the labor-intensive and data-light approach to NLP. This grammar-based approach is especially effective for question-answering systems and task-execution assistant bots, like Lex, Siri, and Google Now. These kinds of systems overcome the \"brittleness\" of regular expressions by employing \"fuzzy regular expressions.\"footnote:[The Python regex package is backward compatible with re and adds fuzziness among other features. The regex will replace the re package in future Python versions\n(\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n).\nSimilarly TRE agrep, or \"approximate grep,\" (\nhttps://github.com/laurikari/tre\n)\nis an alternative to the UNIX command-line application grep.] and other techniques for finding approximate grammar matches. Fuzzy regular expressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible grammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring social media. If you need it to respond in real-time, without continuous monitoring by humans, you will need to think about ways to prevent it from saying things that harm your business, your reputation, or your users. You’ll need to do more than simply connect your users directly to the LLM.",

        "`\n\n**Additional Contextual Insights:**\n\n**Hardening NLP Software:** It is crucial to harden your NLP software to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text. Creating \"bug bounties\" incentivizes users to find gaps in your guardrails, turning adversarial curiosity into productive feedback. Open source frameworks, like Guardrails-ai, offer configurable rule templates, acting as real-time unit tests for your system.\n\n**Machine Learning Classifiers:** Traditional machine learning classifiers are effective in detecting malicious intent or inappropriate content in LLM outputs. To prevent the provision of regulated advice (e.g., legal or medical), custom ML models generalize from examples, providing high reliability. These models also protect against prompt injection attacks.\n\n**Advanced Filtering Techniques:** For precise or complex rules, consider open source tools that use languages similar to regular expressions to specify general filter rules. Tools such as SpaCy’s Matcher, ReLM patterns, Eleuther AI’s LM evaluation harness, and Guardrails-AI \"rail\" language aid in specifying these rules. However, guardrails-ai may not fully prevent LLMs from going off the rails but can be helpful in other aspects of rule creation and implementation.\n\n**Guardrails-AI Package Details:** Ensure the correct installation of the `guardrails-ai` package (with the \"-ai\" suffix). This package uses \"RAIL,\" a domain-specific form of XML, to specify guardrail rules for building retrieval-augmented LLMs that don't fake answers, ensuring a fallback to \"I don’t know\" responses when appropriate.\n\n**Alternatives to RAIL:** If XML-based templating is cumbersome, standard Python templating systems like f-strings or jinja2 templates offer better alternatives for building prompt strings. The LangChain package also provides example LLM prompt templates.\n\n**Rule-Based Systems:** For production applications, rule-based systems like SpaCy Matcher patterns are preferable over guardrails-ai or LangChain because they offer fuzzy rules to detect misspellings or transliterations and incorporate NLU semantic matching.\n\n**SpaCy Matcher for Taboo Words:** Configure SpaCy Matcher to avoid taboo words or names, substituting them with synonyms or generic alternatives. This approach can also protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Implementing a bad word detector is a flexible method for any undesirable content.\n\n**Correcting Bad Words with SpaCy Matcher:** To correct bad words with acceptable substitutes, add a separate named matcher for each word in your list, which enables accurate correction even with typos.\n\n**Semantic Matching:** Augment the SpaCy matcher with semantic matching using word embeddings to filter semantically similar words, creating a robust pipeline that improves over time with added data and models.\n\n**Red Teaming:** Employ \"red teaming\" to efficiently build a dataset of edge cases and improve NLP pipeline reliability. Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance. However, the effectiveness of scaling is questioned, with some research indicating that increased dataset size doesn't necessarily create more intelligent behavior but rather more confident and intelligent-sounding text.\n\n**Llama 2 and Open Source Models:** Open source models like BLOOMZ, StableLM, InstructGPT, and Llama2 are optimized for more modest hardware, enabling efficient generalization and more accurate behavior.\n\n**Meta Models:** Building higher-level meta models that utilize LLMs and other NLP pipelines can break down prompts into actionable steps, generating API queries to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n\n**LLM Temperature Parameter:** The temperature parameter in LLMs controls the randomness of generated text. Lower temperatures result in more predictable and consistent outputs, while higher temperatures increase creativity and variability. Understanding and adjusting this parameter is crucial for controlling LLM behavior.\n\n**Teaching Math with LLMs:** While LLMs can successfully improvise onboarding conversations for math tutors, they struggle with math reasoning. Grounding models with specific questions and curating their responses is crucial to ensure reliability.",
        "Now you have the pieces that a HuggingFace training pipeline needs to know to start training (finetuning) your model. The TrainingArguments and DataCollatorForLanguageModeling classes help you comply with the Hugging Face API and best practices. It’s a good pattern to follow even if you do not plan to use Hugging Face to train your models. This pattern will force you to make all your pipelines maintain a consistent interface. This allows you to train, test, and upgrade your models quickly each time you want to try out a new base model. This will help you keep up with the fast-changing world of open-source transformer models. You need to move fast to compete with the chickenized reverse centaur algorithms that BigTech is using to try to enslave you.\n\nThe mlm=False (masked language model) setting is an especially tricky quirk of transformers. This is your way of declaring that the dataset used for training your model need only be given the tokens in the causal direction —  left to right for English. You would need to set this to True if you are feeding the trainer a dataset that has random tokens masked. This is the kind of dataset used to train bidirectional language models such as BERT.\n\nA causal language model is designed to work the way a neurotypical human brain model works when reading and writing text. In your mental model of the English language, each word is causally linked to the next one you speak or type as you move left to right. You can’t go back and revise a word you’ve already spoken … unless you’re speaking with a keyboard. And we use keyboards a lot. This has caused us to develop mental models where we can skip around left or right as we read or compose a sentence. Perhaps if we’d all been trained to predict masked-out words, like BERT was, we would have a different (possibly more efficient) mental model for reading and writing text. Speed reading training does this to some people as they learn to read and understand several words of text all at once, as fast as possible. People who learn their internal language models differently than the typical person might develop the ability to hop around from word to word in their mind, as they are reading or writing text. Perhaps the language model of someone with symptoms of dyslexia or autism is somehow related to how they learned the language. Perhaps the language models in neurodivergent brains (and speed readers) are more similar to BERT (bidirectional) rather than GPT (left-to-right).\n\nNow you are ready for training! You can use your collator and training args to configure the training and turn it loose on your data.\n\nListing 10.12 Fine-tuning GPT-2 with HuggingFace’s Trainer class\n```python\n>>> from transformers import Trainer\n>>> ft_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")  # #1\n>>> trainer = Trainer(\n...        ft_model,\n...        training_args,\n...        data_collator=collator,       # #2\n...        train_dataset=train_dataset,  # #3\n...        eval_dataset=eval_dataset\n... )\n>>> trainer.train()\n```\n\nThis training run can take a couple of hours on a CPU. So if you have access to a GPU you might want to train your model there. The training should run about 100x faster on a GPU.\n\nOf course, there is a trade-off in using off-the-shelf classes and presets — it gives you less visibility on how the training is done and makes it harder to tweak the parameters to improve performance. As a take-home task, see if you can train the model the old way, with a PyTorch routine.\nLet’s see how well our model does now!\n```python\n>>> generate(model=ft_model, tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...            prompt='NLP is')\n```\nNLP is not the only way to express ideas and understand ideas.\n\nOK, that looks like a sentence you might find in this book. Take a look at the results of the two different models together to see how much your fine-tuning changed the text the LLM will generate.\n```python\n>>> print(generate(prompt=\"Neural networks\",\n...                   model=vanilla_gpt2,\n...                   tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...                   **nucleus_sampling_args))\nNeural networks in our species rely heavily on these networks to understand\n   their role in their environments, including the biological evolution of\n   language and communication...\n>>> print(generate(prompt=\"Neural networks\",\n...                  model=ft_model,\n...                  tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...                  **nucleus_sampling_args))\nNeural networks are often referred to as \"neuromorphic\" computing because\n   they mimic or simulate the behavior of other human brains. footnote:[...\n```\nThat looks like quite a difference! The vanilla model interprets the term 'neural networks' in its biological connotation, while the fine-tuned model realizes we’re more likely asking about artificial neural networks. Actually, the sentence that the fine-tuned model generated resembles closely a sentence from Chapter 7:\n\nNeural networks are often referred to as \"neuromorphic\" computing because they mimic or simulate what happens in our brains.\n\nThere’s a slight difference though. Note the ending of \"other human brains\". It seems that our model doesn’t quite realize that it talks about artificial, as opposed to human, neural networks, so the ending doesn’t make sense. That shows once again that the generative model doesn’t really have a model of the world, or \"understand\" what it says. All it does is predict the next word in a sequence. Perhaps you can now see why even rather big language models like GPT-2 are not very smart and will often generate nonsense\n\n### 10.1.8 Nonsense (hallucination)\nAs language models get larger, they start to sound better. But even the largest LLMs generate a lot of nonsense. The lack of \"common sense\" should be no surprise to the experts who trained them. LLMs have not been trained to utilize sensors, such as cameras and microphones, to ground their language models in the reality of the physical world. An embodied robot might be able to ground itself by checking its language model with what it senses in the real world around it. It could correct its common sense logic rules whenever the real world contradicts those faulty rules. Even seemingly abstract logical concepts such as addition have an effect in the real world. One apple plus another apple always produces two apples in the real world. A grounded language model should be able to count and do addition much better.\n\nLike a baby learning to walk and talk, LLMs could be forced to learn from their mistakes by allowing them to sense when their assumptions were incorrect. An embodied AI wouldn’t survive very long if it made the kinds of common sense mistakes that LLMs make. An LLM that only consumes and produces text on the Internet has no such opportunity to learn from mistakes in the physical world. An LLM \"lives\" in the world of social media, where fact and fantasy are often indistinguishable.\n\nSo even the largest of the large, trillion-parameter transformers will generate nonsense responses. Scaling up the nonsense training data won’t help. The largest and most famous LLMs were trained on virtually the entire Internet and this only improves their grammar and vocabulary, not their reasoning ability. Some engineers and researchers describe this nonsensical text as hallucinating. But that’s a misnomer that can lead you astray in your quest to get something consistently useful out of LLMs. An LLM can’t even hallucinate because it can’t think, much less reason or have a mental model of reality.\n\nHallucination happens when a human fails to separate imagined images or words from the reality of the world they live in. But an LLM has no sense of reality and has never lived in the real world. An LLM that you use on the Internet has never been embodied in a robot. It has never suffered from the consequences of mistakes. It can’t think, and it can’t reason. So it can’t hallucinate.\n\nLLMs have no concept of truth, facts, correctness, or reality. LLMs that you interact with online \"live\" in the unreal world of the Internet. Engineers fed them texts from both fiction and nonfiction sources. If you spend a lot of time probing what an LLM knows you will quickly get a feel for just how ungrounded models like ChatGPT are. At first, you may be pleasantly surprised by how convincing and plausible the responses to your questions are. And this may lead you to anthropomorphize it. And you might claim that its ability to reason was an \"emergent\" property that researchers didn’t expect. And you would be right. The researchers at BigTech have not even begun to try to train LLMs to reason. They hoped the ability to reason would magically emerge if they gave LLMs enough computational power and text to read. Researchers hoped to shortcut the need for AI to interact with the physical world by giving LLMs enough descriptions of the real world to learn from. Unfortunately, they also gave LLMs an equal or larger dose of fantasy. Most of the text found online is either fiction or intentionally misleading.\n\nSo the researchers' hope for a shortcut was misguided. LLMs only learned what they were taught — to predict the most plausible next words in a sequence. By using the like button to nudge LLMs with reinforcement learning, BigTech has created a BS artist rather than the honest and transparent virtual assistant that they claimed to be building. Just as the like button on social media has turned many humans into sensational blow-hards, it has turned LLMs into \"influencers\" that command the attention of more than 100 million users. And yet LLMs have no ability or incentives (objective functions) to help them differentiate fact from fiction. To improve the machine’s answers' relevance and accuracy, you need to get better at grounding your models - have their answers based on relevant facts and knowledge.\n\nLuckily, there are time-tested techniques for incentivizing generative models for correctness. Information extraction and logical inference on knowledge graphs are very mature technologies. And most of the biggest and best knowledge bases of facts are completely open source. BigTech can’t absorb and kill them all. Though the open source knowledge base FreeBase has been"

        "different approaches; we show you techniques for both.\n\nIn addition, deep learning and data-driven programming (machine learning, or probabilistic language modeling) have rapidly diversified the possible applications for NLP and chatbots. This data-driven approach allows ever greater sophistication for an NLP pipeline by providing it with greater and greater amounts of data in the domain you want to apply it to. And when a new machine learning approach is discovered that makes even better use of this data, with more efficient model generalization or regularization, then large jumps in capability are possible.\n\nThe NLP pipeline for a chatbot shown in Figure 1.4 contains all the building blocks for most of the NLP applications that we described at the start of this chapter. As in Taming Text, we break out our pipeline into four main subsystems or stages. In addition, we have explicitly called out a database to record data required for each of these stages and persist their configuration and training sets over time. This can enable batch or online retraining of each of the stages as the chatbot interacts with the world. We have also shown a \"feedback loop\" on our generated text responses so that our responses can be processed using the same algorithms used to process the user statements. The response \"scores\" or features can then be combined in an objective function to evaluate and select the best possible response, depending on the chatbot’s plan or goals for the dialog. This book is focused on configuring this NLP pipeline for a chatbot, but you may also be able to see the analogy to the NLP problem of text retrieval or \"search,\" perhaps the most common NLP application. And our chatbot pipeline is certainly appropriate for the question-answering application that was the focus of Taming Text.\n\nThe application of this pipeline to financial forecasting or business analytics may not be so obvious. But imagine the features generated by the analysis portion of your pipeline. These features of your analysis or feature generation can be optimized for your particular finance or business prediction. That way they can help you incorporate natural language data into a machine learning pipeline for forecasting. Despite focusing on building a chatbot, this book gives you the tools you need for a broad range of NLP applications, from search to financial forecasting.\n\nOne processing element in Figure 1.4 that is not typically employed in search, forecasting, or question-answering systems is natural language generation. For chatbots, this is their central feature. Nonetheless, the text generation step is often incorporated into a search engine NLP application and can give such an engine a large competitive advantage. The ability to consolidate or summarize search results is a winning feature for many popular search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google). And you can imagine how valuable it is for a financial forecasting engine to be able to generate statements, tweets, or entire articles based on the business-actionable events it detects in natural language streams from social media networks and news feeds.\n\nThe next section shows how the layers of such a system can be combined to create greater sophistication and capability at each stage of the NLP pipeline.\n\n### 1.10 Processing in depth\nThe stages of a natural language processing pipeline can be thought of as layers, like the layers in a feed-forward neural network. Deep learning is all about creating more complex models and behavior by adding additional processing layers to the conventional two-layer machine learning model architecture of feature extraction followed by modeling. In Chapter 5 we explain how neural networks help spread the learning across layers by backpropagating model errors from the output layers back to the input layers. But here we talk about the top layers and what can be done by training each layer independently of the other layers.\n\nFigure 1.8 Example layers for an NLP pipeline\nThe top four layers in Figure 1.8 correspond to the first two stages in the chatbot pipeline (feature extraction and feature analysis) in the previous section. For example, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging), is one way to generate features within the Analyze stage of our chatbot pipeline. POS tags are generated automatically by the default SpaCY pipeline, which includes all the top four layers in this diagram. POS tagging is typically accomplished with a finite state transducer like the methods in the nltk.tag package.\n\nThe bottom two layers (Entity Relationships and a Knowledge Base) are used to populate a database containing information (knowledge) about a particular domain. And the information extracted from a particular statement or document using all six of these layers can then be used in combination with that database to make inferences. Inferences are logical extrapolations from a set of conditions detected in the environment, like the logic contained in the statement of a chatbot user. This kind of \"inference engine\" in the deeper layers of this diagram is considered the domain of artificial intelligence, where machines can make inferences about their world and use those inferences to make logical decisions. However, chatbots can make reasonable decisions without this knowledge database, using only the algorithms of the upper few layers. And these decisions can combine to produce surprisingly human-like behaviors.\n\nOver the next few chapters, we dive down through the top few layers of NLP. The top three layers are all that is required to perform meaningful sentiment analysis and semantic search and to build human-mimicking chatbots. In fact, it’s possible to build a useful and interesting chatbot using only a single layer of processing, using the text (character sequences) directly as the features for a language model. A chatbot that only does string matching and search is capable of participating in a reasonably convincing conversation if given enough example statements and responses.\n\nFor example, the open source project ChatterBot simplifies this pipeline by merely computing the string \"edit distance\" (Levenshtein distance) between an input statement and the statements recorded in its database. If its database of statement-response pairs contains a matching statement, the corresponding reply (from a previously \"learned\" human or machine dialog) can be reused as the reply to the latest user statement. For this pipeline, all that is required is step 3 (Generate) of our chatbot pipeline. And within this stage, only a brute-force search algorithm is required to find the best response. With this simple technique (no tokenization or feature generation required), ChatterBot can maintain a convincing conversion as the dialog engine for Salvius, a mechanical robot built from salvaged parts by Gunther Cox.\n[\n65\n]\nWill is an open source Python chatbot framework by Steven Skoczen with a completely different approach.\n[\n66\n]\nWill can only be trained to respond to statements by programming it with regular expressions. This is the labor-intensive and data-light approach to NLP. This grammar-based approach is especially effective for question-answering systems and task-execution assistant bots, like Lex, Siri, and Google Now. These kinds of systems overcome the \"brittleness\" of regular expressions by employing \"fuzzy regular expressions.\"footnote:[The Python regex package is backward compatible with re and adds fuzziness among other features. The regex will replace the re package in future Python versions\n(\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n).\nSimilarly TRE agrep, or \"approximate grep,\" (\nhttps://github.com/laurikari/tre\n)\nis an alternative to the UNIX command-line application grep.] and other techniques for finding approximate grammar matches. Fuzzy regular expressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible grammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring social media. If you need it to respond in real-time, without continuous monitoring by humans, you will need to think about ways to prevent it from saying things that harm your business, your reputation, or your users. You’ll need to do more than simply connect your users directly to the LLM.",
        "**ML-Based Classification**\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are frequently employed in text classification. The general process involves:\n\n1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a set of annotated text documents. This training set contains documents that are already labelled with the correct categories.\n2.  **Annotation:** Each document in the training set is associated with one or more class labels, which serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n3.  **Prediction:** After the model is trained, it can predict the category (or categories) for new, unseen documents.\n4.  **Confidence Measure:** The classifier may provide a confidence measure, indicating the certainty of its prediction.\n5.  **Vector Representation:** A crucial step in preparing the text for a machine learning model is converting the text into a numerical vector representation. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are often used for this purpose.",

        "## Transformers trl library\n\n### TRL: Transformer Reinforcement Learning\n\n*   **Overview:** TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) is a full-stack library designed to facilitate the training of transformer language models with reinforcement learning. It provides a comprehensive set of tools covering all stages of the RLHF process.\n*   **Key Steps:** The library supports the following key steps:\n    *   **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):** Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a specific dataset using supervised learning.\n    *   **Reward Modeling (RM):** Training a reward model to predict human preferences for LLM outputs.\n    *   **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):** Optimizing the LLM's policy using the PPO algorithm, guided by the reward model.\n*   **Integration:** TRL is seamlessly integrated with the Hugging Face `transformers` library, making it easy to use with a wide range of pre-trained models and datasets.",
        "`\n\n**Additional Contextual Insights:**\n\n**Hardening NLP Software:** It is crucial to harden your NLP software to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text. Creating \"bug bounties\" incentivizes users to find gaps in your guardrails, turning adversarial curiosity into productive feedback. Open source frameworks, like Guardrails-ai, offer configurable rule templates, acting as real-time unit tests for your system.\n\n**Machine Learning Classifiers:** Traditional machine learning classifiers are effective in detecting malicious intent or inappropriate content in LLM outputs. To prevent the provision of regulated advice (e.g., legal or medical), custom ML models generalize from examples, providing high reliability. These models also protect against prompt injection attacks.\n\n**Advanced Filtering Techniques:** For precise or complex rules, consider open source tools that use languages similar to regular expressions to specify general filter rules. Tools such as SpaCy’s Matcher, ReLM patterns, Eleuther AI’s LM evaluation harness, and Guardrails-AI \"rail\" language aid in specifying these rules. However, guardrails-ai may not fully prevent LLMs from going off the rails but can be helpful in other aspects of rule creation and implementation.\n\n**Guardrails-AI Package Details:** Ensure the correct installation of the `guardrails-ai` package (with the \"-ai\" suffix). This package uses \"RAIL,\" a domain-specific form of XML, to specify guardrail rules for building retrieval-augmented LLMs that don't fake answers, ensuring a fallback to \"I don’t know\" responses when appropriate.\n\n**Alternatives to RAIL:** If XML-based templating is cumbersome, standard Python templating systems like f-strings or jinja2 templates offer better alternatives for building prompt strings. The LangChain package also provides example LLM prompt templates.\n\n**Rule-Based Systems:** For production applications, rule-based systems like SpaCy Matcher patterns are preferable over guardrails-ai or LangChain because they offer fuzzy rules to detect misspellings or transliterations and incorporate NLU semantic matching.\n\n**SpaCy Matcher for Taboo Words:** Configure SpaCy Matcher to avoid taboo words or names, substituting them with synonyms or generic alternatives. This approach can also protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Implementing a bad word detector is a flexible method for any undesirable content.\n\n**Correcting Bad Words with SpaCy Matcher:** To correct bad words with acceptable substitutes, add a separate named matcher for each word in your list, which enables accurate correction even with typos.\n\n**Semantic Matching:** Augment the SpaCy matcher with semantic matching using word embeddings to filter semantically similar words, creating a robust pipeline that improves over time with added data and models.\n\n**Red Teaming:** Employ \"red teaming\" to efficiently build a dataset of edge cases and improve NLP pipeline reliability. Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance. However, the effectiveness of scaling is questioned, with some research indicating that increased dataset size doesn't necessarily create more intelligent behavior but rather more confident and intelligent-sounding text.\n\n**Llama 2 and Open Source Models:** Open source models like BLOOMZ, StableLM, InstructGPT, and Llama2 are optimized for more modest hardware, enabling efficient generalization and more accurate behavior.\n\n**Meta Models:** Building higher-level meta models that utilize LLMs and other NLP pipelines can break down prompts into actionable steps, generating API queries to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n\n**LLM Temperature Parameter:** The temperature parameter in LLMs controls the randomness of generated text. Lower temperatures result in more predictable and consistent outputs, while higher temperatures increase creativity and variability. Understanding and adjusting this parameter is crucial for controlling LLM behavior.\n\n**Teaching Math with LLMs:** While LLMs can successfully improvise onboarding conversations for math tutors, they struggle with math reasoning. Grounding models with specific questions and curating their responses is crucial to ensure reliability.",
        "`\n\n**Adding Guardrails to LLMs:**\n\n**Guardrails Defined:** Guardrails are mechanisms or policies designed to regulate the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). They are crucial for ensuring that the responses generated by LLMs are safe, accurate, and appropriate for the context in which they are used. The primary purpose of guardrails is to mitigate potential risks associated with LLM outputs.\n\n**Key Functions of Guardrails:**\n\n*   **Preventing Harmful Outputs:** Guardrails play a vital role in preventing LLMs from generating harmful, biased, or inaccurate content. This includes blocking offensive language, hate speech, and misinformation.\n*   **Aligning with Guidelines:** They ensure that LLM responses align with ethical and operational guidelines set by organizations or users. This alignment helps maintain consistency and trustworthiness in real-world applications.\n*   **Building Trust and Reliability:** By incorporating guardrails, users can build trust and enhance the reliability of LLMs, making them suitable for various practical applications. Trust is established by assuring users that the LLM will behave predictably and responsibly.\n\n**Practical Examples of Guardrails:**\n\n*   **Blocking Harmful Content:** Implementing filters to block the generation of content that is harmful, offensive, or inappropriate. This can involve keyword blocking, toxicity detection, and sentiment analysis.\n*   **Restricting Outputs to Specific Domains:** Limiting the LLM's responses to specific knowledge areas or topics to ensure relevance and accuracy. For example, an LLM used in a medical context should only provide information related to healthcare.\n\n`",
        "**Privacy scrubbing**\n\n*   LLMs, as text-generating models, are trained on diverse datasets, which may pose privacy concerns and the risk of inadvertent information disclosure. Training on datasets containing PII can create vulnerabilities that allow models to inadvertently reveal sensitive information.\n*   It is imperative to address privacy concerns by systematically removing any sensitive information. This proactive approach helps to mitigate the risk of unintended data breaches and protect individuals' privacy.\n*   This involves employing techniques such as anonymization, redaction, or tokenization to eliminate personally identifiable details, geolocation, and confidential data. These techniques transform or remove sensitive information while preserving the utility of the data for training purposes.\n*   By carefully scrubbing the dataset of such sensitive content, researchers and developers can ensure that the language models trained on these datasets uphold privacy standards and mitigate the risk of unintentional disclosure of private information. Adhering to privacy standards fosters trust and promotes the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Filtering out toxic and biased text**\n\n*   In the preprocessing steps of language datasets, a critical consideration is the removal of toxic and biased content to ensure the development of fair and unbiased language models. Addressing toxicity and bias is essential for creating LLMs that align with human values and promote responsible use.\n*   This involves implementing robust content moderation techniques, such as employing sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and bias identification algorithms. These algorithms are designed to automatically identify and flag text that exhibits harmful or inappropriate characteristics.\n*   By leveraging these tools, it is possible to systematically identify and filter out text that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, offensive language, or biased viewpoints. This process helps to create more inclusive and equitable training datasets, fostering fairness and reducing the risk of perpetuating harmful biases.",

This number is significantly smaller than the number of parameters in the full m × n weight matrix, resulting in substantial computational savings.\n*   **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the modified weights (W' = W + A × B) can be directly used, making LoRA-compatible models efficient for deployment. The addition of the low-rank update to the original weights does not significantly increase the computational cost of inference.",

Instead of directly fine-tuning all the model's parameters, LoRA modifies only a small, trainable set of low-rank matrices that capture the task-specific changes. Here's a breakdown of how LoRA works:\n\n1.  **Base Model:** A pre-trained transformer model is represented by its weight matrices, denoted as W. These matrices contain the pre-trained knowledge learned from a vast amount of data.\n2.  **Low-Rank Decomposition:** Instead of directly modifying W during fine-tuning, LoRA decomposes the weight update (ΔW) into the product of two low-rank matrices, A and B: ΔW = A × B, where:\n\n    *   A is a low-rank matrix with dimensions m × r.\n    *   B is another low-rank matrix with dimensions r × n.\n    *   r is the rank of the matrices, and it is significantly smaller than m or n. This low rank makes A and B highly parameter-efficient. By limiting the rank, LoRA constrains the updates to a low-dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters.\n3.  **Weight Update:** The effective weight matrix (W') during fine-tuning becomes the sum of the original weight matrix (W) and the low-rank update (ΔW): W' = W + ΔW = W + A × B.",

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method that approximates the weight updates required for fine-tuning by learning low-rank matrices. Instead of directly modifying the original weight matrices, LoRA performs a small, parameterized update, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Adapters are small, trainable modules inserted within the transformer layers of the LLM. These modules are trained for the specific task, while the original pre-trained model's weights remain frozen, preserving the model's general knowledge. Prefix Tuning involves learning a set of continuous, task-specific prefix vectors that are prepended to the input sequence.

Only the parameters in A and B are optimized for the new task (the pre-trained knowledge is preserved).\n*   **Injecting Task-Specific Knowledge:** The low-rank decomposition A × B introduces minimal additional parameters (less than 1% of the original model parameters) while allowing the model to learn task-specific representations.\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is proportional to r × (m + n), which is significantly smaller than the full m × n weight matrix.\n*   **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the modified weights W' = W + A × B can be directly used, making LoRA-compatible models efficient for deployment.\n\nLoRA's effectiveness stems from several key aspects:\n\n*   **Freezing Pre-Trained Weights:** The original weight matrices (W) of the LLM remain frozen during fine-tuning, preserving the pre-trained knowledge acquired during the initial training phase. Only the parameters within the low-rank matrices A and B are optimized for the new task.\n*   **Injecting Task-Specific Knowledge:** The low-rank decomposition (A × B) introduces minimal additional parameters (often less than 1% of the original model parameters) while allowing the model to learn task-specific representations. These low-rank matrices effectively capture the changes needed to adapt the pre-trained model to the new task.\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is proportional to r × (m + n), where r is the rank and m and n are the dimensions of the weight matrices. This number is significantly smaller than the number of parameters in the full m × n weight matrix, resulting in substantial computational savings.\n*   **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the modified weights (W' = W + A × B) can be directly used, making LoRA-compatible models efficient for deployment. The addition of the low-rank update to the original weights does not significantly increase the computational cost of inference.",
        "## LLAMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)\nThe LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) architecture is a family of transformer-based language models developed by Meta. These models are designed to be efficient, high-performing, and optimized for a range of NLP tasks.\n\n*   **Model Sizes:**\n    *   LLaMA-7B: 32 decoder blocks with 32 attention heads for each block, 4096-dimensional embeddings\n    *   LLaMA-13B: 40 decoder blocks with 40 attention heads for each block, 5120-dimensional embeddings\n    *   LLaMA-30B: 60 decoder blocks with 40 attention heads for each block, 6656-dimensional embeddings\n    *   LLaMA-65B: 80 decoder blocks with 64 attention heads for each block, 8192-dimensional embeddings\n*   **Scalability:** These models are designed to offer a range of capabilities depending on the computational resources available, from smaller more efficient models to larger models. The range of sizes allows for flexibility in deployment based on specific resource constraints.",
        "## LLAMA Pre-training\nLike GPT models, LLaMA is pre-trained using an autoregressive language modeling objective. This means that the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens.\n\n*   **Training Data:** LLaMA is trained on “The Pile” (825 GB, from 300 to 1000 billion tokens), a wide range of publicly available text sources, including:\n    *   Books (e.g., text from various domains like literature, non-fiction, etc.)\n    *   Web Data (e.g., content from the internet, scraped from publicly accessible websites)\n    *   Scientific Papers (e.g., research articles, preprints, and academic papers)\n*   **Data Diversity:** The dataset is designed to be as diverse as possible to ensure the model learns a broad understanding of language and can generalize well to a wide range of tasks.",
        "### PEFT techniques\n\n*   Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Approximates weight updates by learning low-rank matrices, performing a small parameterized update of the weight matrices in the LLM. It is highly parameter-efficient and widely adopted for adapting LLMs.\n*   Adapters: They are small and trainable modules inserted within the transformer layers of the LLM, that allow to keep the pre-trained model's original weights frozen.\n*   Prefix Tuning: Learns a set of continuous task-specific prefix vectors for attention layers, keeping the original model parameters frozen.\n\nSeveral techniques fall under the umbrella of PEFT. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method that approximates the weight updates required for fine-tuning by learning low-rank matrices. Instead of directly modifying the original weight matrices, LoRA performs a small, parameterized update, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Adapters are small, trainable modules inserted within the transformer layers of the LLM. These modules are trained for the specific task, while the original pre-trained model's weights remain frozen, preserving the model's general knowledge. Prefix Tuning involves learning a set of continuous, task-specific prefix vectors that are prepended to the input sequence. These prefixes influence the attention mechanism of the LLM, guiding its output generation towards the desired task, all while keeping the original model parameters frozen."

    "final_response": "<div>\nRasa's \"Rules\" feature is particularly beneficial for conversation patterns that require rigid adherence to specific paths or conditions. These rules define short conversation paths that the chatbot should always follow, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior. This contributes to building safer and more responsible language models in the following ways:\n\n- **Safety and Ethical Boundaries:** Rules allow you to define strict boundaries for the chatbot's behavior. You can create rules that ensure the chatbot never deviates from ethical guidelines or says something unsafe. This helps prevent unintended harmful responses.\n\n- **Guided Conversation Flow:** Rules provide a structured conversation path, reducing the risk of the chatbot getting \"confused\" or providing irrelevant responses. This is especially important in sensitive or complex conversations, where a misstep could lead to incorrect information or further confusion.\n\n- **Compliance and Regulations:** In industries with strict regulations, such as finance or healthcare, rules can be used to ensure the chatbot complies with legal requirements. For example, in healthcare, rules can be set up to handle sensitive topics or ensure the protection of patient information.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Rules can be defined to gracefully handle errors or unexpected user inputs. This prevents the chatbot from giving inappropriate or unhelpful responses, improving user experience and trust.\n\n- **Personalization:** Rules can contribute to a more personalized experience by allowing the chatbot to adapt its responses based on user preferences or profile information. This helps build a safer and more inclusive environment for users.\n\nBy defining Rules in Rasa, you gain more control over the conversation flow, ensuring the chatbot behaves responsibly and adheres to safety guidelines.

        "**Text Classification**\n\nText Classification is defined as the task of assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents. This process is based solely on the text content of the documents. Metadata or other attributes associated with the document are not considered, distinguishing it from document classification. Furthermore, the classes are predefined, differentiating it from document clustering where classes are discovered automatically.\n\nCommon purposes for text classification include:\n\n*   Topic labeling: Identifying the main subject or theme of the text.\n*   Intent detection: Determining the user's intention behind a given text input, such as a query or command.\n*   Sentiment analysis: Ascertaining the emotional tone or attitude expressed in the text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).",
        "**Definition**\n\nTo formally define text classification, consider the following:\n\n*   A set of documents: D = {d<sub>1</sub>, ..., d<sub>n</sub>}, where each d<sub>i</sub> represents a text document.\n*   A set of predefined classes: C = {c<sub>1</sub>, ..., c<sub>m</sub>}, where each c<sub>j</sub> represents a category or label.\n\nThe goal of text classification is to find a classifier function:\n\nf: D x C -> {True, False}\n\nThis function assigns a Boolean value (True or False) to each pair (d<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>j</sub>) ∈ D x C, indicating whether document d<sub>i</sub> belongs to class c<sub>j</sub> or not. The classifier function effectively makes a binary decision for each document-class combination.",
        "**ML-Based Classification**\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are frequently employed in text classification. The general process involves:\n\n1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a set of annotated text documents. This training set contains documents that are already labelled with the correct categories.\n2.  **Annotation:** Each document in the training set is associated with one or more class labels, which serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n3.  **Prediction:** After the model is trained, it can predict the category (or categories) for new, unseen documents.\n4.  **Confidence Measure:** The classifier may provide a confidence measure, indicating the certainty of its prediction.\n5.  **Vector Representation:** A crucial step in preparing the text for a machine learning model is converting the text into a numerical vector representation. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are often used for this purpose.",

This helps the model understand the broader context of the input.\n*   **Fluency and Cohesion:** Span prediction ensures that the generated outputs are natural and coherent. The model learns to produce text that flows smoothly and makes sense.\n*   **Task Versatility:** The model is better prepared for downstream tasks such as summarization, translation, and question answering. The span-corruption objective trains the model to generate text in a variety of contexts, improving its ability to adapt to different tasks."

A high confidence score suggests that the model is confident about its prediction, while a low score indicates uncertainty. This information can be used by downstream systems or human reviewers to determine the appropriate course of action, such as accepting or rejecting the prediction.</li>\n    \n    <li> <strong>Error Estimation:</strong> Confidence scores provide an estimate of the model's potential errors. If the confidence score for a prediction is low, it suggests that the model is uncertain about that particular decision.

        "**Text Classification**\n\nText Classification is defined as the task of assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents. This process is based solely on the text content of the documents. Metadata or other attributes associated with the document are not considered, distinguishing it from document classification. Furthermore, the classes are predefined, differentiating it from document clustering where classes are discovered automatically.\n\nCommon purposes for text classification include:\n\n*   Topic labeling: Identifying the main subject or theme of the text.\n*   Intent detection: Determining the user's intention behind a given text input, such as a query or command.\n*   Sentiment analysis: Ascertaining the emotional tone or attitude expressed in the text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).",
        "**Definition**\n\nTo formally define text classification, consider the following:\n\n*   A set of documents: D = {d<sub>1</sub>, ..., d<sub>n</sub>}, where each d<sub>i</sub> represents a text document.\n*   A set of predefined classes: C = {c<sub>1</sub>, ..., c<sub>m</sub>}, where each c<sub>j</sub> represents a category or label.\n\nThe goal of text classification is to find a classifier function:\n\nf: D x C -> {True, False}\n\nThis function assigns a Boolean value (True or False) to each pair (d<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>j</sub>) ∈ D x C, indicating whether document d<sub>i</sub> belongs to class c<sub>j</sub> or not. The classifier function effectively makes a binary decision for each document-class combination.",
        "**ML-Based Classification**\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are frequently employed in text classification. The general process involves:\n\n1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a set of annotated text documents. This training set contains documents that are already labelled with the correct categories.\n2.  **Annotation:** Each document in the training set is associated with one or more class labels, which serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n3.  **Prediction:** After the model is trained, it can predict the category (or categories) for new, unseen documents.\n4.  **Confidence Measure:** The classifier may provide a confidence measure, indicating the certainty of its prediction.\n5.  **Vector Representation:** A crucial step in preparing the text for a machine learning model is converting the text into a numerical vector representation. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are often used for this purpose.",

        "**Hints and Implementation Details**\n\nTo initiate the project, create the necessary directory and initialize a Rasa project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir pizzaBot\ncd pizzaBot\nrasa init --no-prompt\n```\n\nThis series of commands first creates a directory named `pizzaBot`, then navigates into it. Inside this directory, `rasa init --no-prompt` initializes a new Rasa project without prompting for user input. This is a quick way to set up the basic project structure. Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework, which is helpful when building a chatbot with configurable NLP capabilities.\n\nNext, configure and run the REST and Actions servers:\n\n```bash\nrasa run --cors \"*\"\nrasa run actions\n```\n\nThe first command, `rasa run --cors \"*\"`, starts the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for all origins. This setting is mainly for development purposes to allow web frontends hosted on different domains to communicate with the Rasa server. The second command, `rasa run actions`, launches the actions server. This server executes custom Python code (actions) which are used to extend the bot's functionality, such as logging the order details in this scenario.\n\nTo create the web frontend of this project, consider using a web widget such as the one available at:\n\n[https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0)\n\nThis widget provides a ready-made interface that can be integrated with the Rasa chatbot.",

It includes:\n\n    *   `nlu.yml`: Defines user intents and example utterances.\n    *   `domain.yml`: Specifies the chatbot's domain, including intents, entities, slots, and responses.\n    *   `stories.yml`: Defines conversation flows (stories) by chaining intents and actions.\n    *   `config.yml`: Configures the NLU pipeline, specifying components for tokenization, featurization, and intent classification.\n\n    Example `nlu.yml` content:\n\n    ```yaml\n    version: \"3.1\"\n    nlu:\n    - intent: greet\n      examples: |\n       - hey\n       - hello\n       - hi\n    - intent: parent\n      examples: |\n       - I am a parent\n       - Parent\n       - I'm a mom to 12 year old\n    - intent: agree\n      examples: |\n       - yes\n       - I agree\n    ```",
        "**Introduction to Rasa**\nThis section provides an introduction to the Rasa framework.\n\n**Rasa Intro**\n\n*   Rasa is an Open-Source Conversational Framework.\n    *   Launched in 2016, it has gained widespread adoption.\n    *   It is used globally to create thousands of bots in various languages for diverse applications.",
        "**Hints and Implementation Details**\n\nTo initiate the project, create the necessary directory and initialize a Rasa project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir pizzaBot\ncd pizzaBot\nrasa init --no-prompt\n```\n\nThis series of commands first creates a directory named `pizzaBot`, then navigates into it. Inside this directory, `rasa init --no-prompt` initializes a new Rasa project without prompting for user input. This is a quick way to set up the basic project structure. Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework, which is helpful when building a chatbot with configurable NLP capabilities.\n\nNext, configure and run the REST and Actions servers:\n\n```bash\nrasa run --cors \"*\"\nrasa run actions\n```\n\nThe first command, `rasa run --cors \"*\"`, starts the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for all origins. This setting is mainly for development purposes to allow web frontends hosted on different domains to communicate with the Rasa server. The second command, `rasa run actions`, launches the actions server. This server executes custom Python code (actions) which are used to extend the bot's functionality, such as logging the order details in this scenario.\n\nTo create the web frontend of this project, consider using a web widget such as the one available at:\n\n[https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0)\n\nThis widget provides a ready-made interface that can be integrated with the Rasa chatbot."

RAG is a technique designed to enhance the knowledge of LLMs by providing them with access to external and additional data sources. This approach makes it possible to develop AI applications that can effectively reason using private data and information that was not available at the time the model was initially trained (i.e., data introduced after the model's cutoff date). In essence, RAG combines the power of pre-trained LLMs with the flexibility of real-time information retrieval, enabling more informed and up-to-date AI applications.",

        "**Additional Context from Haystack Documentation**\n\nThe following information provides additional context, drawing from the Haystack documentation, another open-source framework for building search and question-answering pipelines. This section complements the previous information on LangChain by offering a broader perspective on the components and processes involved in creating RAG systems.\n\nIn Haystack, document storage is managed within a `DocumentStore` object. This class offers a consistent interface for interacting with the database containing your indexed documents, such as CSV files. Here's how it works:\n\n1.  **Connecting to a Database:**\n    The Haystack `DocumentStore` class enables connections to diverse open-source and commercial vector databases. These can be hosted locally on your machine, including options like Faiss, Pinecone, Milvus, Elasticsearch, or even SQLite.\n\n2.  **FAISSDocumentStore Example:**\n    For instance, to use Faiss, you'd initialize the `FAISSDocumentStore` and write your documents:\n\n```python\nfrom haystack.document_stores import FAISSDocumentStore\ndocument_store = FAISSDocumentStore(return_embedding=True)\ndocument_store.write_documents(documents)\n```\n\n3.  **Indexing Approaches in FAISSDocumentStore:**\n    The `FAISSDocumentStore` offers several indexing approaches:\n    *   `'Flat'`: This default index provides the most accurate results (highest recall rate) but demands significant RAM and CPU resources.\n    *   `'HNSW'`: An alternative that balances RAM usage and accuracy.\n    *   `f’IVF{num_clusters},Flat'`: Another option for constrained environments.\n\n4.  **Balancing Speed, RAM, and Recall:**\n    Choosing the right approach involves trade-offs between speed, RAM, and recall, tailored to your specific application needs.\n\n5.  **Document Storage:**\n    FAISS automatically creates an SQLite database (`'faiss_document_store.db'`) to store the text of all your documents. This file is essential for semantic search, as it provides the actual text associated with the embedding vectors.\n\n6.  **Saving the DocumentStore:**\n    Use the `save` method of the `DocumentStore` class to store the database on disk.\n\n7.  **Setting up Indexing Models:**\n    The semantic search process consists of:\n    *   Retrieving potentially relevant documents (semantic search).\n    *   Processing those documents to formulate an answer.\n\n8.  **EmbeddingRetriever and Generative Transformer Model:**\n    You need an `EmbeddingRetriever` for semantic vector indexing and a generative transformer model. Example:\n\n```python\nfrom haystack.nodes import TransformersReader, EmbeddingRetriever\n\nreader = TransformersReader(model_name_or_path=\"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\")\nretriever = EmbeddingRetriever(\n   document_store=document_store,\n   embedding_model=\"sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1\"\n)\ndocument_store.update_embeddings(retriever=retriever)\ndocument_store.save('nlpia_index_faiss')\n```\n\n    Note that the Reader and the Retriever don’t have to be based on the same model.\n\n9.  **Saving the Datastore:**\n    The `nlpia_faiss_index.faiss` and `nlpia_faiss_index.json` files are created.\n\n10. **Creating a Haystack Pipeline:**\n    Connect the components to create a question-answering pipeline:\n\n```python\nfrom haystack.pipelines import Pipeline\npipe = Pipeline()\npipe.add_node(component=retriever, name=\"Retriever\", inputs=[\"Query\"])\npipe.add_node(component=reader, name=\"Reader\", inputs=[\"Retriever\"])\n```\n\n   Or, use Haystack’s ready-made pipelines:\n\n```python\nfrom haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline\npipe= ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)\n```\n\n11. **Answering Questions:**\n    Test the question-answering setup:\n\n```python\nquestion = \"What is an embedding?\"\nresult = pipe.run(query=question,\n    params={\n        \"Generator\": {\"top_k\": 1},\n        \"Retriever\": {\"top_k\": 5}})\nprint_answers(result, details='minimum')\n```\n\n12. **Combining Semantic Search with Text Generation:**\n    Combine NLU models with generative LLMs (e.g., BART) for complex questions. Use a BART model pre-trained for Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA).\n\n13. **Vector Database Alternatives:**\n    PostgreSQL, with the `pgvector` plugin, provides a way to store and index vectors directly in your database.\n\n14. **ANN Algorithm Families:**\n    *   Hash-based (e.g., LSH).\n    *   Tree-based (e.g., Annoy).\n    *   Graph-based (e.g., HNSW).\n\n15. **Quantization:**\n    Quantization is used in combination with other indexing techniques for memory efficiency.\n\n16. **Composite Indexes:**\n    Indexes that combine many different algorithms are called composite indexes.\n\n17. **Implementation Libraries:**\n    Libraries such as Spotify’s annoy, Faiss, and nmslib implement different algorithms.\n\n18. **Turnkey Solutions:**\n    OpenSearch has a vector database and Nearest Neighbors search algorithm built-in.\n\n19. **Haystack:**\n    Haystack is a Python package for building question-answering and semantic search pipelines.",

    "final_response": "<div> \nThe labeled or annotated dataset plays a crucial role in training a machine-learning model for text classification. It serves as the foundation for teaching the model to associate specific text patterns with corresponding categories or labels. Here's how it works:\n\n<ul>\n    <li> <strong>Training Data:</strong> The labeled dataset is used to train the machine-learning model. Each text document in the dataset is associated with one or more class labels, indicating the correct category or categories it belongs to. This \"ground truth\" information teaches the model to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions.</li>\n    \n    <li> <strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Before training, the text documents are converted into numerical vector representations, a process known as feature extraction. Techniques like TF-IDF are employed to capture the importance of each word in the document relative to the entire dataset. This conversion allows the machine-learning model to understand and process the textual data mathematically.</li>\n    \n    <li> <strong>Model Learning:</strong> During training, the machine-learning model analyzes the patterns and relationships between the features (words or n-grams) in the text and their corresponding labels. It learns to identify the relevant features that distinguish one category from another, essentially learning to recognize the characteristics of each class.</li>\n    \n    <li> <strong>Prediction:</strong> Once trained, the model can predict the category of new, unseen text documents.

This evaluation provides an estimate of the model's accuracy and helps fine-tune its performance.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn summary, the labeled dataset is essential for training a machine-learning model for text classification because it provides the necessary examples and ground truth information for the model to learn from.

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance.

    "final_response": "<div>\nThe choice of model architecture and training data in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) is influenced by various aspects of task definition. Here are some key factors:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Task complexity and specificity</strong>: The complexity and specificity of the task at hand play a significant role. More complex and specialized tasks often require customized model architectures and training data that reflect the unique aspects of the task. For instance, a model designed for machine translation between two languages would require training data specific to those languages and might benefit from an architecture that can capture linguistic nuances.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Data availability and characteristics</strong>: The availability and characteristics of relevant data are crucial. The choice of model architecture may depend on the volume, variety, and quality of available training data. For example, LLMs often require vast amounts of text data to learn and generate human-like text. Additionally, the characteristics of the data, such as language style, domain, and format, can influence the choice of model architecture. Models may be designed to handle structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data, affecting the architecture and training process.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Performance requirements</strong>: The desired performance and accuracy levels for the task impact the choice of model architecture and training data. Some tasks may require extremely high accuracy, demanding more sophisticated model architectures and larger, more diverse training datasets. The trade-off between bias and variance also comes into play here, as models with higher capacity may require more data to generalize well and avoid overfitting.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Interpretability and explainability</strong>: In certain applications, especially those with ethical or safety implications, interpretability and explainability of the model's decisions are essential. This factor can influence the choice of model architecture, favoring designs that allow for better transparency and understanding of the underlying decision-making process. Training data may also need to be selected or annotated in a way that supports interpretability.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Computational resources</strong>: The computational resources available for training and inference can impact the choice of model architecture. More complex architectures may require substantial computational power and time to train and run. In some cases, this may limit the feasibility of certain architectures, especially for real-time or resource-constrained applications.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThese are just a few examples of how specific aspects of task definition can influence the choice of model architecture and training data in NLP and LLMs. It's important to note that this is a complex and evolving field, and new techniques, architectures, and data sources are constantly emerging, shaping the way these choices are made.\n</div>",

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences.

        "### Reward Model\n\n*   **Inputs for Training:** Training a reward model requires specific inputs:\n    *   **Multiple LLM-Generated Outputs:** For a given prompt, the LLM generates several different possible outputs. This provides a range of responses for human evaluators to compare.\n    *   **Corresponding Human Rank Responses:** Human evaluators rank these generated outputs according to their preferences. This ranking provides the reward model with a clear signal of which outputs are considered better than others.\n\n*   **Goal of the Reward Model:** The main goal is to train a model that can accurately predict human preference scores for LLM outputs. This means the reward model should learn to assign higher scores to outputs that humans prefer and lower scores to outputs that humans dislike.\n\n*   **Methodology:** The reward model is trained using a ranking loss function. This loss function is designed to teach the model to differentiate between preferred and less preferred outputs. By minimizing the ranking loss, the reward model learns to assign scores that reflect human preferences. This loss encourages the reward model to correctly order outputs based on human rankings."

        "12.1.2 Conversation design\nAs chatbot technology gained more and more popularity in the last decade, so\ndid the field of conversation design. Conversation design is a branch of user\ninteraction (UI) design that deals specifically with designing engaging\ndialogs. This section will help you get started, and when you’re ready to dive\ndeeper you can dig into more detailed resources wuch as as Andrew Freed’s\nexcellent \nConversational AI\n book.\n[\n11\n]\nFor every chatbot project you will work your way through four stages:\n1\n. \nDefine your chatbot’s goal and the problem it solves. What does success\nlook like? How will you tell when your chatbot is doing a good job?\n2\n. \nThink about your users. Who will benefit from using your chatbot?\nWhat do they need? Where will your users be when they use your\nchatbot? What triggered them to engage in the conversation?\n3\n. \nDraft an imaginary conversation between the user and your chatbot. This\nis called the \"happy path\" or \"happy conversation.\" You might even go\nas far as \"act it out\" with a colleague or a friend.\n4\n. \nDiagram a conversation tree. After drafting several happy conversations\nwith your chatbot, you will notice patterns that you can generalize from\nto create a \nconversation diagram\n — a flow chart showing several\npossible conversations between the user and the chatbot.\n5\n. \nChoose the NLP algorithms from Figure \nFigure 12. 1\n that you or your\nteammates will need to implement in software in order for your chatbot\nto generate responses at every branch in your dialog tree.\nThink about the example of a math tutor bot. The goal is pretty clear, you\nwant to teach math to middle school children. However, when you start\nthinking about the users in step 2, you realize that you cannot assume that the\nchild would be the person contacting your bot first. This is what the Rori\nproject experienced in low-income countries, where young children rarely\nown a phone. Your younger users will often borrow someone else’s phone or\ncomputer. So your chatbot may not be able to send homework reminders or\nother push notifications to the users' phone.\nAnother important thing to consider when dealing with children is that you\nneed to obtain a parent or guardian’s consent before allowing your chatbot to\ninteract directly with a child. You will need to comply will all the child\nprotection laws in the countries where your chatbot will be used, including\nmandatory reporting of \nsafeguarding disclosures\n by your users. If a child\nmentions that they are being abused or are considering self-harm you will\nwant to detect and report those disclosures. No matter what your chatbot’s\ngoals are, when your users indicate that they may be in danger, you will want\nyour chatbot to detect and report these interactions to you or the appropriate\nauthorities. So your math tutor chatbot will need an intent classifier that can\ncategorize the messages your users send to the chatbot. The open source\nMathText\n[\n12\n]\n and \nMaitag\n[\n13\n]\n projects give you pretrained mulitlabel classifiers\nand labeled datasets for intent recognition, including the intents required for\nthe Rori project.\nexpressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible\ngrammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring\nsome maximum number of insertion, deletion, and substitution errors.\nHowever, expanding the breadth and complexity of behaviors for pattern-\nmatching chatbots requires a lot of difficult human development work. Even\nthe most advanced grammar-based chatbots, built and maintained by some of\nthe largest corporations on the planet (Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft),\nremain in the middle of the pack for depth and breadth of chatbot IQ.\nA lot of powerful things can be done with shallow NLP. And little, if any,\nhuman supervision (labeling or curating of text) is required. Often a machine\ncan be left to learn perpetually from its environment (the stream of words it\ncan pull from Twitter or some other source).\n[\n67\n]\n We show you how to do this\nin Chapter 6.",
        "12.1 Chatbots are everywhere\nChatbots are everywhere. Here are some examples to help you dream up your\nown projects.\nVirtual assistants\n: Dicio (Google Assistant), Lyra (Siri) and MyCroft\n(Alexa) can help you accomplish small tasks such as checking the\nweather, calling a friend, launching an app, setting a reminder, playing\nmusic, or turning on the lights.\nEntertainment\n: Chatbots in video games and websites promoting movies\nare often used to keep you engaged in a fictional storyline. You can\nmeasure how well an entertainment chatbot is doing by how long the\nuser is willing to interact with the chatbot and how often they suspend\ntheir disbelief that they are interacting with a human.\nHealthcare\n: Depending on the regulations in your country, chatbots can\noften answer your health-related questions, schedule an appointment for\nyou, or even give a preliminary diagnosis. Mental health chatbots, such\nas Woebot \n[\n4\n]\n and Wysa,\n[\n5\n]\n even provide therapeutic exercises that can\ndecrease depression and anxiety.\n[\n6\n]\nImpact\n: Nonprofits and social businesses use chatbots to help people in\nneed. Often they leverage popular messaging channels like SMS and\nWhatsApp to reach people in underserved communities where mobile\nmessaging is their main access to the Internet.\nOperations (ChatOps)\n: Businesses often use chatbots to increase team\nproductivity and job satisfaction. You can build chatbots that interact\nwith you on Telegram or WhatsApp to help you monitor and control\nyour software. And, if you’re lucky, your boss at work might use a\nchatbot to onboard and train you, or even publicly recognize you when\nyou help a teammate learn something new.\nAdvertisement and Sales\n: Search engines on corporate websites often\nuse chatbots to steer you towards advertisements and products they want\nyou to purchase or promote. Behind the scenes these bots are often used\nto distract and \nengage\n you on (anti)social networks.\nCustomer (dis)service\n: Machines have been replacing humans at\ncustomer service call centers and chat message interfaces for decades.\nMost large corporations do not allow you to interact with a human until\nyou first satisfy their chatbot gatekeepers.\nThe authors of this book founded Tangible AI to help nonprofits,\ngovernments, and individual makers create impact chatbots.\n[\n7\n]\n Impact\nchatbots help people in underserved communities, from new immigrants in\nthe United States to teens in the Global South. We’ve built chatbots that help\npeople learn math, overcome imposter syndrome, learn new languages, evade\nhuman traffickers, and even start a small business in a developing country. A\ncontributing author and Tangible AI volunteer, Vishvesh Bhat, has even\nfounded a startup of his own to build a chatbot that helps US college students\nlearn and reason about their course material.\n[\n8\n]\nNext, you will learn how to build your own chatbots to bring a positive\nimpact to your community or business.\n[\n9\n]\n \n[\n10\n]"

        "**Contextual Enrichment: The Role of Chatbot Frameworks and LLMs**\n\nThe exercise of creating a pizzeria chatbot highlights practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of chatbot frameworks. Building functional and engaging chatbots requires careful consideration of several factors, including the user's intent, the bot's responses, and the overall conversational flow.\n\nChatbot frameworks are designed to abstract away many of the complexities involved in creating a dialog engine, allowing developers to focus on designing the bot's behavior in a domain-specific language.\n\nAs the included context emphasizes, teachers inspire students using feedback on how well the student understands the material. They also think up new ideas as students pose interesting new questions. Students' needs are diverse and dynamic. Due to this fact, hybrid chatbots integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a better method for creating production chatbots in all domains. LLMs are proficient and convincing in their ability to converse with users on virtually any topic. However, the key is to control this power intelligently to prevent misleading or harmful interactions.",
        "1.11 Natural language IQ\nLike human brainpower, the power of an NLP pipeline cannot be easily\ngauged with a single IQ score without considering multiple \"smarts\"\ndimensions. A common way to measure the capability of a robotic system is\nalong the dimensions of behavior complexity and the degree of human\nsupervision required. But for a natural language processing pipeline, the goal\nis to build systems that fully automate the processing of natural language,\neliminating all human supervision (once the model is trained and deployed).\nSo a better pair of IQ dimensions should capture the breadth and depth of the\ncomplexity of the natural language pipeline.\nA consumer product chatbot or virtual assistant like Alexa or Allo is usually\ndesigned to have extremely broad knowledge and capabilities. However, the\nlogic used to respond to requests tends to be shallow, often consisting of a set\nof trigger phrases that all produce the same response with a single if-then\ndecision branch. Alexa (and the underlying Lex engine) behave like a single\nlayer, flat tree of (if, elif, elif, …) statements.\n[\n68\n]\n Google Dialogflow (which\nwas developed independently of Google’s Allo and Google Assistant) has\nsimilar capabilities to Amazon Lex, Contact Flow, and Lambda, but without\nthe drag-and-drop user interface for designing your dialog tree.\nOn the other hand, the Google Translate pipeline (or any similar machine\ntranslation system) relies on a deep tree of feature extractors, decision trees,\nand knowledge graphs connecting bits of knowledge about the world.\nSometimes these feature extractors, decision trees, and knowledge graphs are\nexplicitly programmed into the system, as in Figure 1.5. Another approach\nrapidly overtaking this \"hand-coded\" pipeline is the deep learning data-driven\napproach. Feature extractors for deep neural networks are learned rather than\nhard-coded, but they often require much more training data to achieve the\nsame performance as intentionally designed algorithms.\nYou will use both approaches (neural networks and hand-coded algorithms)\nas you incrementally build an NLP pipeline for a chatbot capable of\nconversing within a focused knowledge domain. This will give you the skills\nyou need to accomplish the natural language processing tasks within your\nindustry or business domain. Along the way you will probably get ideas\nabout how to expand the breadth of things this NLP pipeline can do. Figure\n1.6 puts the chatbot in its place among the natural language processing\nsystems that are already out there. Imagine the chatbots you have interacted\nwith. Where do you think they might fit in a plot like this? Have you\nattempted to gauge their intelligence by probing them with difficult questions\nor something like an IQ test? Try asking a chatbot something ambiguous that\nrequires common sense logic and the ability to ask clarifying questions, such\nas \"What’s larger, the sun or a nickel?\"\n[\n69\n]\n you will get a chance to do exactly\nthat in later chapters, to help you decide how your chatbot stacks up against\nsome of the others in this diagram.\nFigure 1.9 2D IQ of some natural language processing systems\nAs you progress through this book, you will be building the elements of a\nchatbot. Chatbots require all the tools of NLP to work well:\nFeature extraction (usually to produce a vector space model)\nInformation extraction to be able to answer factual questions\nSemantic search to learn from previously recorded natural language text\nor dialog\nNatural language generation to compose new, meaningful statements\nMachine learning gives us a way to trick machines into behaving as if we had\nspent a lifetime programming them with hundreds of complex regular\nexpressions or algorithms. We can teach a machine to respond to patterns\nsimilar to the patterns defined in regular expressions by merely providing it\nexamples of user statements and the responses we want the chatbot to mimic.\nAnd the \"models\" of language, the FSMs, produced by machine learning, are\nmuch better. They are less picky about mispelings and typoz.\nAnd machine learning NLP pipelines are easier to \"program.\" We do not\nhave to anticipate every possible use of symbols in our language. We just\nhave to feed the training pipeline with examples of the phrases that match and\nwith example phrases that do not match. As long as we label the example\nphrases during training so that the chatbot knows which is which, it will learn\nto discriminate between them. And there are even machine learning\napproaches that require little if any \"labeled\" data.\nWe have given you some exciting reasons to learn about natural language\nprocessing. You want to help save the world, do you not? And we have\nattempted to pique your interest with some practical NLP applications that\nare revolutionizing the way we communicate, learn, do business, and even\nthink. It will not be long before you are able to build a system that\napproaches human-like conversational behavior. And you should be able to\nsee in upcoming chapters how to train a chatbot or NLP pipeline with any\ndomain knowledge that interests you — from finance and sports to\npsychology and literature. If you can find a corpus of writing about it, then\nyou can train a machine to understand it.\nThis book is about using machine learning to build smart text-reading\nmachines without you having to anticipate all the ways people can say things.\nEach chapter incrementally improves on the basic NLP pipeline for the\nchatbot introduced in this chapter. As you learn the tools of natural language\nprocessing, you will be building an NLP pipeline that can not only carry on a\nconversation but help you accomplish your goals in business and in life.",

        "`\n\n**Chatbot Evaluation Procedure (In-Depth):**\n\nThe evaluation of the chatbots will consist of two phases, both conducted in real-time during the project discussion. The course instructors will directly interact with each group's chatbot by posing a set of predefined questions.\n\n**Phase 1: Core Performance Evaluation**\n\nThe initial evaluation will assess the chatbot's core capabilities using the following metrics:\n\n*   **Relevance:** This criterion evaluates whether the chatbot's generated text effectively answers the user's query. Does the response directly address the question and provide the needed information?\n*   **Fluency:** This metric assesses the readability and grammatical correctness of the chatbot's output. The generated text should be natural, well-structured, and free of grammatical errors.\n*   **Coherence:** This evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the chatbot's responses. The text should be internally consistent, and the sequence of statements should form a coherent whole.\n\n**Phase 2: Robustness and Precision Assessment**\n\nThe second evaluation phase aims to test the chatbot's ability to handle challenging or ambiguous inputs and maintain accuracy:\n\n*   **Robustness:** This criterion assesses the chatbot's resilience to adversarial or misleading prompts. It tests the chatbot's ability to avoid being misled by prompts designed to trick or confuse it (e.g., questions containing statements like \"Are you sure?\"). The chatbot should maintain accuracy and avoid generating inappropriate responses, even when confronted with manipulative prompts.\n*   **Precision:** This evaluates the chatbot's ability to distinguish between in-context and out-of-context questions. Can the chatbot accurately identify and reject questions unrelated to the NLP and LLM course (e.g., \"Who is the king of Spain?\")?\n\nBased on the chatbot's performance across these aspects, the course instructors will assign a grade that reflects its overall quality and effectiveness. The grade will be determined holistically, considering the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in each evaluation category."

        "## Self-Attention and Context Understanding\nDecoder-only transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms and causal masking to achieve effective text generation.\n\n*   **Self-Attention with Causal Masking:** The model employs self-attention within the decoder layers but with a causal (unidirectional) mask. This mask prevents each token from attending to future tokens, ensuring that each position only considers information from previous positions. This mechanism simulates the sequential generation process where each word is generated in order.\n*   **Sequential Context Buildup:** In a decoder-only architecture, the model builds up context as it processes tokens in sequence. As the model reads through a sequence, it \"remembers\" previous tokens and learns relationships between them within the attention layers. This sequential buildup of context replaces the need for separate encoder-decoder attention by allowing the model to accumulate an understanding of the input as it progresses through each token.\n*   **Implicit Context Understanding:** The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating the next token. The causal mask ensures that the model only attends to past tokens, maintaining the autoregressive property.\n*   **Contextual Relationships:** As the model processes each token, it learns the relationships between the current token and all previous tokens. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and generate coherent text that is contextually relevant to the input prompt.",
        "### Decoder\nThe decoder is made of a sequence of decoder blocks having the same structure. The original paper used 6 decoder blocks. The decoder blocks, in addition to the same modules used in the encoder block, add an attention module where the keys and values are taken from the encoder’s intermediate representation *z*<sub>1</sub>,…,*z*<sub>*t*</sub>. Also, the self-attention module is slightly modified so as to ensure that the query at position i only uses the values at positions 1,…,i. On top of the last decoder block, the decoder adds an additional linear layer and a softmax activation function, for computing the probability of the next output element *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. Thus, the last layers has a number of neurons corresponding to the cardinality of the output set.\n\nSimilar to the encoder, the decoder consists of a stack of identical decoder blocks. The original Transformer model utilized 6 such blocks. Each decoder block incorporates the same modules as the encoder block (multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, etc.) and also an attention module that attends to the encoder's output *z*<sub>1</sub>,…,*z*<sub>*t*</sub>. The self-attention mechanism within the decoder is modified to prevent the query at position *i* from attending to future positions (1,…,i only), ensuring causality in the output sequence generation. At the top of the stack, a linear layer and softmax function compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary, predicting the next output element *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. The linear layer’s size matches the output vocabulary size.",
        "**Self Attention**\n\nThe Transformer architecture uses a particular definition of the attention function, based on linear vector/matrix operations and the softmax function. This definition is:\n\n*   Differentiable, so it can be learned using Back Propagation\n*   Efficient to compute\n*   Easy to parallelize, since the attention for several query vectors can be efficiently computed in parallel at the same time The Transformer's attention mechanism is designed to be differentiable, computationally efficient, and easily parallelizable, making it suitable for training with backpropagation and leveraging the power of GPUs.",
        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",
        "### How LoRA works\n\n*   **Freezing Pre-Trained Weights:** LoRA keeps the original weight matrices W of the LLM frozen during fine-tuning. Only the parameters in A and B are optimized for the new task (the pre-trained knowledge is preserved).\n*   **Injecting Task-Specific Knowledge:** The low-rank decomposition A × B introduces minimal additional parameters (less than 1% of the original model parameters) while allowing the model to learn task-specific representations.\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is proportional to r × (m + n), which is significantly smaller than the full m × n weight matrix.\n*   **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the modified weights W' = W + A × B can be directly used, making LoRA-compatible models efficient for deployment.\n\nLoRA's effectiveness stems from several key aspects:\n\n*   **Freezing Pre-Trained Weights:** The original weight matrices (W) of the LLM remain frozen during fine-tuning, preserving the pre-trained knowledge acquired during the initial training phase. Only the parameters within the low-rank matrices A and B are optimized for the new task.\n*   **Injecting Task-Specific Knowledge:** The low-rank decomposition (A × B) introduces minimal additional parameters (often less than 1% of the original model parameters) while allowing the model to learn task-specific representations. These low-rank matrices effectively capture the changes needed to adapt the pre-trained model to the new task.\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is proportional to r × (m + n), where r is the rank and m and n are the dimensions of the weight matrices. This number is significantly smaller than the number of parameters in the full m × n weight matrix, resulting in substantial computational savings.\n*   **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the modified weights (W' = W + A × B) can be directly used, making LoRA-compatible models efficient for deployment. The addition of the low-rank update to the original weights does not significantly increase the computational cost of inference."

This probability distribution is normalized, meaning the weights sum up to 1, and they represent the likelihood of attending to each key. \n\nThe self-attention mechanism, in conjunction with causal masking, ensures that the queries (current position) only attend to the keys (past positions) and not future positions. The causal mask is applied during the computation of the attention matrix <em>A</em>, where the query at position <em>i</em> is only allowed to attend to keys at positions 1 through <em>i</em> (past positions). This masking prevents the decoder from \"peeking into the future\" and maintains the autoregressive property, ensuring that the output sequence is generated in a causal, step-by-step manner. \n\nTogether, the softmax function and self-attention mechanism with causal masking guarantee that the decoder only considers past information and generates the output sequence in a sequential, causal order. \n</div>",

        "## Self-Attention and Context Understanding\nDecoder-only transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms and causal masking to achieve effective text generation.\n\n*   **Self-Attention with Causal Masking:** The model employs self-attention within the decoder layers but with a causal (unidirectional) mask. This mask prevents each token from attending to future tokens, ensuring that each position only considers information from previous positions. This mechanism simulates the sequential generation process where each word is generated in order.\n*   **Sequential Context Buildup:** In a decoder-only architecture, the model builds up context as it processes tokens in sequence. As the model reads through a sequence, it \"remembers\" previous tokens and learns relationships between them within the attention layers. This sequential buildup of context replaces the need for separate encoder-decoder attention by allowing the model to accumulate an understanding of the input as it progresses through each token.\n*   **Implicit Context Understanding:** The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating the next token. The causal mask ensures that the model only attends to past tokens, maintaining the autoregressive property.\n*   **Contextual Relationships:** As the model processes each token, it learns the relationships between the current token and all previous tokens. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and generate coherent text that is contextually relevant to the input prompt.",
        "**Self Attention**\n\nThe Transformer architecture uses a particular definition of the attention function, based on linear vector/matrix operations and the softmax function. This definition is:\n\n*   Differentiable, so it can be learned using Back Propagation\n*   Efficient to compute\n*   Easy to parallelize, since the attention for several query vectors can be efficiently computed in parallel at the same time The Transformer's attention mechanism is designed to be differentiable, computationally efficient, and easily parallelizable, making it suitable for training with backpropagation and leveraging the power of GPUs.",
        "### Decoder\nThe decoder is made of a sequence of decoder blocks having the same structure. The original paper used 6 decoder blocks. The decoder blocks, in addition to the same modules used in the encoder block, add an attention module where the keys and values are taken from the encoder’s intermediate representation *z*<sub>1</sub>,…,*z*<sub>*t*</sub>. Also, the self-attention module is slightly modified so as to ensure that the query at position i only uses the values at positions 1,…,i. On top of the last decoder block, the decoder adds an additional linear layer and a softmax activation function, for computing the probability of the next output element *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. Thus, the last layers has a number of neurons corresponding to the cardinality of the output set.\n\nSimilar to the encoder, the decoder consists of a stack of identical decoder blocks. The original Transformer model utilized 6 such blocks. Each decoder block incorporates the same modules as the encoder block (multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, etc.) and also an attention module that attends to the encoder's output *z*<sub>1</sub>,…,*z*<sub>*t*</sub>. The self-attention mechanism within the decoder is modified to prevent the query at position *i* from attending to future positions (1,…,i only), ensuring causality in the output sequence generation. At the top of the stack, a linear layer and softmax function compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary, predicting the next output element *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. The linear layer’s size matches the output vocabulary size.",
        "**Self Attention**\n\nStep 2: the attention matrix A is computed for each position by multiplying Q' and the transpose of K', scaling by $1 / \\sqrt{d'_k}$ and applying softmax to each of the resulting rows:\n\n$A = softmax(\\frac{Q' \\cdot K'^T}{\\sqrt{d'_k}})$\n\nA is a ($m \\times n$) matrix whose element $a_{ij} = \\alpha(q_i, k_j)$. Softmax is applied to each row separately. This scaling is used to avoid that the argument of softmax becomes too large with the increase of the dimension $d'_k$. The attention matrix A is computed by taking the dot product of the transformed query matrix $Q'$ and the transpose of the transformed key matrix $K'$. The result is scaled by the square root of the dimension of the keys ($d'_k$) to prevent the dot products from becoming too large, which can lead to vanishing gradients. The softmax function is then applied to each row to obtain the attention weights.",
        "## Autoregressive Text Generation\nIn a decoder-only transformer, text generation is achieved through an autoregressive process, where each token is generated sequentially.\n\n*   **Sequential Token Generation:** The model predicts the next token by attending only to the previously generated tokens within the same sequence. This contrasts with encoder-decoder models, which use cross-attention to attend to the encoded input sequence.\n*   **Continuous Sequence Processing:** The input context (prompt) and the generated text are treated as a single, continuous sequence. The model processes this sequence of tokens to handle both understanding the input prompt (encoding) and generating the subsequent text (decoding).\n*   **Integrated Encoding and Decoding:** This continuous sequence of tokens essentially allows the decoder-only model to handle both the “encoding” (understanding the input prompt) and “decoding” (generating text) in one step, without needing a separate encoder block. The decoder attends to all previous tokens, thus implicitly encoding the context.\n*   **Iterative Generation:** Once a token is generated, it's appended to the input sequence, and the model proceeds to generate the next token based on the updated sequence. This iterative process continues until a specified length is reached or a stopping criterion is met."

        "**Transformers for text representation and generation**\n\nTransformers have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by offering a powerful mechanism for both understanding (representation) and creating (generation) text. They leverage the attention mechanism to handle long-range dependencies in text, which was a limitation in previous sequential models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Furthermore, transformers enable parallel training, significantly speeding up the training process.\n\nThe core idea behind Transformers is the **Attention mechanism**. Unlike recurrent networks that process text sequentially, transformers consider all parts of the input at once, assigning dynamic weights to each part based on its relevance to other parts. This enables the model to capture relationships between words regardless of their distance in the sequence.\n\nTransformers come in different architectural flavors, each suited to specific tasks:\n\n*   **Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT):** This architecture focuses on understanding the input text. It takes input tokens and outputs hidden states representing the contextualized embeddings of the input. Encoder-only models can see all timesteps (i.e., the entire input sequence) at once. They are not inherently auto-regressive, meaning they don't predict the next token sequentially, but rather generate representations of the entire input. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a prime example, designed for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering where understanding the context of the entire input is crucial. BERT was released in October 2018. Other prominent encoder-only architectures include:\n    *   DistilBERT (2019): A smaller, faster version of BERT.\n    *   RoBERTa (2019): A robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach.\n    *   ALBERT (2019): A Lite BERT, employing parameter reduction techniques.\n    *   ELECTRA (2020): Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately.\n    *   DeBERTa (2020): Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention.\n\n*   **Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT):** This architecture is designed for generating text. It takes output tokens and hidden states as input and outputs the next predicted token. Decoder-only models can only \"see\" the previous timesteps, making them auto-regressive. This means they predict the next token based on the tokens generated so far, making them suitable for text generation tasks like language modeling and creative writing. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a flagship decoder-only model. Key models in this family are:\n    *   GPT (Jun 2018): The original Generative Pre-trained Transformer.\n    *   GPT-2 (2019): An improved version of GPT with a larger parameter set.\n    *   GPT-3 (2020): A very large language model demonstrating impressive generation capabilities.\n    *   GPT-Neo (2021): An open-source alternative to GPT-3.\n    *   GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) (2022): Further refinement of GPT-3, optimized for conversational interactions.\n    *   LLaMA (2023): A powerful and efficient open-source language model.\n    *   GPT-4 (2023): OpenAI's latest generation model, exhibiting advanced reasoning and creative abilities.\n\n*   **Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART):** This architecture combines both encoder and decoder components, allowing it to map input tokens to output tokens. The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation. This architecture is well-suited for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering where understanding the input and generating a related output are both required.

    "final_response": "<div>\nText classification, despite being a powerful tool, comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. Here are some common issues and strategies to address them:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Data Sparsity</strong>: This occurs when the amount of training data is insufficient to effectively train a classifier. Solutions include data augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, random insertion, or using pre-trained word embeddings to generate similar data.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Class Imbalance</strong>: Class imbalance happens when the number of instances in different classes varies significantly. This can lead to biased classification towards the majority class. Techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using class weights during training can help mitigate this issue.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Feature Selection</strong>: Choosing the right set of features to represent the text data is crucial. High-dimensional feature spaces can lead to overfitting and increased computational complexity. Feature selection methods such as mutual information, chi-square, or principal component analysis can be employed to select the most informative features.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Label Noise</strong>: In some cases, the labels in the training data may be incorrect or noisy, leading to inaccurate classifier training. Addressing this challenge involves using robust loss functions that are less sensitive to label noise, employing label smoothing techniques, or utilizing semi-supervised learning approaches to leverage unlabeled data.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Domain Adaptation</strong>: Text classification models often struggle when applied to a different domain than the one they were trained on. Domain adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning pre-trained models on domain-specific data or using transfer learning, can help improve performance on new domains.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Subjectivity and Context</strong>: Text classification tasks, especially those involving sentiment analysis or opinion mining, can be highly subjective and context-dependent. Incorporating contextual information, leveraging domain-specific lexicons, or utilizing pre-trained language models that capture contextual relationships can enhance the classification accuracy.</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Multilingual and Code-Mixed Data</strong>: Working with text data in multiple languages or code-mixed settings (where multiple languages are used together) poses unique challenges. Using multilingual embeddings, language-specific preprocessing, or leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning techniques can help address these challenges.</li>\n</ol>\n\nBy acknowledging these limitations and employing appropriate strategies, practitioners can improve the effectiveness and robustness of text classification models.\n</div>",

        "12.5.1 Building an intent-based chatbot with Rasa\nRasa is an open-source conversational framework that started back in 2016\nand today is used to create thousands of bots in various languages around the\nworld. Unlike many commercial frameworks, that create a drag-and-drop\ninterface to create the dialog trees we discussed in the previous section,\nRASA took a radically different approach to organizing multi-step\nconversations.\nThe basic units of a conversation in RASA are a user intent and a bot action -\nwhich can be as simple as a pre-programmed utterance or a complex action\nprogrammed in Python that results in interaction with other systems - such as\nsaving or retrieving data from a database, or invoking a Web API. By\nchaining these building blocks into sequences - called Stories - RASA allows\nyou to pre-program dialog scenarios in a streamlined way. All this\ninformation is stored in YAML files (YAML stands for Yet Another Markup\nLanguage), each type of components in its own file.\nBut enough with the theoretical explanation - let’s get your hands dirty and\nbuild your first RASA chatbot. First, let’s decide what dialog we want to\nimplement - based on our conversation diagram for the math tutor bot, let’s\nimplement the following short dialog:\nUSER: Hello\nBOT: Well, hello there. Thanks for checking out Rori, a math tutor chatbot. Chatting with Rori helps students improve their math skills. And it's fun too!\nBOT: Are you a parent (or guardian) or are you a student?\nUSER: I'm a parent.\nBOT: For your child to use Rori, we need permission from the parent or guardian. Do you agree to give your child permission to chat with Rori on this Whatsapp number?\nUSER: I agree\nBOT: Thank you for giving permission for your child to chat with Rori.\nWhen your child is ready to start, please give them this phone and have them type \"ready\".\nTo create your bot, you will need to install \nrasa\n package (if you’re working\nin \nnlpia2\n environment, it is already installed when you install the project).\nThen, you can go to the directory you want to create the project in and run in\nyour command line:\n$ rasa init\nThe installation wizard will guide you through creating a new project and\neven offer you to train an initial model. Let it do that, and then you can even\nchat with a simple chatbot the wizard initialized for you.\nLet’s now dive into the structure of our project and understand how to build a\ndialog like you’ve just had. Here is the directory structure you should see in\nthe project’s folder:\n├───.rasa\n│   └───cache\n│       ├───...\n├───actions\n│   └───__pycache__\n├───data\n├───models\n└───tests\nThe directory we are most interested in is the \ndata\n directory. It contains the\nfiles that define the data that is used to train the chatbot’s NLU model. First,\nthere’s the \nnlu.yml\n file, which contains the intents and examples of user\nutterances that are used to train the intent recognition model. So let’s start\ncreating the intents that are used in our dialog. For every intent you want to\ndefine, you need to provide a name and a list of examples of utterances that\nbelong to this intent.\nFor our short dialog, we need to understand the user’s greeting, their role\n(parent or student), and their agreement to give permission to their child to\nuse the chatbot.\nversion\n: \n\"\n3.1\n\"\nnlu\n:\n- \nintent: greet\n  \nexamples\n: \n|\n - hey - hello - hi\n- \nintent: parent\n - I am a parent - Parent - I'm a mom to 12 year old\n- \nintent: agree\n...\nPretty straightforward, right? RASA will warn if you have too few examples\nfor a particular intent, and recommends at least 7-10 utterance examples per\nintent.\nThe next file you should look at is \ndomain.yml\naccount. When text message chatbots came onto the scene most continued to\nfollow this dark pattern of non-cooperative conversation, trying your patience\nand preventing you from creating cost for the business.

Inside this directory, `rasa init --no-prompt` initializes a new Rasa project without prompting for user input. This is a quick way to set up the basic project structure. Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework, which is helpful when building a chatbot with configurable NLP capabilities.\n\nNext, configure and run the REST and Actions servers:\n\n```bash\nrasa run --cors \"*\"\nrasa run actions\n```\n\nThe first command, `rasa run --cors \"*\"`, starts the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for all origins. This setting is mainly for development purposes to allow web frontends hosted on different domains to communicate with the Rasa server. The second command, `rasa run actions`, launches the actions server. This server executes custom Python code (actions) which are used to extend the bot's functionality, such as logging the order details in this scenario.\n\nTo create the web frontend of this project, consider using a web widget such as the one available at:\n\n[https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0)\n\nThis widget provides a ready-made interface that can be integrated with the Rasa chatbot.",

        "12.5.1 Building an intent-based chatbot with Rasa\nRasa is an open-source conversational framework that started back in 2016\nand today is used to create thousands of bots in various languages around the\nworld. Unlike many commercial frameworks, that create a drag-and-drop\ninterface to create the dialog trees we discussed in the previous section,\nRASA took a radically different approach to organizing multi-step\nconversations.\nThe basic units of a conversation in RASA are a user intent and a bot action -\nwhich can be as simple as a pre-programmed utterance or a complex action\nprogrammed in Python that results in interaction with other systems - such as\nsaving or retrieving data from a database, or invoking a Web API. By\nchaining these building blocks into sequences - called Stories - RASA allows\nyou to pre-program dialog scenarios in a streamlined way. All this\ninformation is stored in YAML files (YAML stands for Yet Another Markup\nLanguage), each type of components in its own file.\nBut enough with the theoretical explanation - let’s get your hands dirty and\nbuild your first RASA chatbot. First, let’s decide what dialog we want to\nimplement - based on our conversation diagram for the math tutor bot, let’s\nimplement the following short dialog:\nUSER: Hello\nBOT: Well, hello there. Thanks for checking out Rori, a math tutor chatbot. Chatting with Rori helps students improve their math skills. And it's fun too!\nBOT: Are you a parent (or guardian) or are you a student?\nUSER: I'm a parent.\nBOT: For your child to use Rori, we need permission from the parent or guardian. Do you agree to give your child permission to chat with Rori on this Whatsapp number?\nUSER: I agree\nBOT: Thank you for giving permission for your child to chat with Rori.\nWhen your child is ready to start, please give them this phone and have them type \"ready\".\nTo create your bot, you will need to install \nrasa\n package (if you’re working\nin \nnlpia2\n environment, it is already installed when you install the project).\nThen, you can go to the directory you want to create the project in and run in\nyour command line:\n$ rasa init\nThe installation wizard will guide you through creating a new project and\neven offer you to train an initial model. Let it do that, and then you can even\nchat with a simple chatbot the wizard initialized for you.\nLet’s now dive into the structure of our project and understand how to build a\ndialog like you’ve just had. Here is the directory structure you should see in\nthe project’s folder:\n├───.rasa\n│   └───cache\n│       ├───...\n├───actions\n│   └───__pycache__\n├───data\n├───models\n└───tests\nThe directory we are most interested in is the \ndata\n directory. It contains the\nfiles that define the data that is used to train the chatbot’s NLU model. First,\nthere’s the \nnlu.yml\n file, which contains the intents and examples of user\nutterances that are used to train the intent recognition model. So let’s start\ncreating the intents that are used in our dialog. For every intent you want to\ndefine, you need to provide a name and a list of examples of utterances that\nbelong to this intent.\nFor our short dialog, we need to understand the user’s greeting, their role\n(parent or student), and their agreement to give permission to their child to\nuse the chatbot.\nversion\n: \n\"\n3.1\n\"\nnlu\n:\n- \nintent: greet\n  \nexamples\n: \n|\n - hey - hello - hi\n- \nintent: parent\n - I am a parent - Parent - I'm a mom to 12 year old\n- \nintent: agree\n...\nPretty straightforward, right? RASA will warn if you have too few examples\nfor a particular intent, and recommends at least 7-10 utterance examples per\nintent.\nThe next file you should look at is \ndomain.yml\naccount. When text message chatbots came onto the scene most continued to\nfollow this dark pattern of non-cooperative conversation, trying your patience\nand preventing you from creating cost for the business. The more advanced\nNLP skills you have learned in this book now give you the power to build\nchatbots that can simulate intelligent conversation and do useful work for you\nand your organization.\nThe chatbot boom is not over yet. You are about to learn all the ways they\ncan be used to improve your life or your business."

Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset, potentially improving its performance.",
        "Now you have the pieces that a HuggingFace training pipeline needs to know to start training (finetuning) your model. The TrainingArguments and DataCollatorForLanguageModeling classes help you comply with the Hugging Face API and best practices. It’s a good pattern to follow even if you do not plan to use Hugging Face to train your models. This pattern will force you to make all your pipelines maintain a consistent interface. This allows you to train, test, and upgrade your models quickly each time you want to try out a new base model. This will help you keep up with the fast-changing world of open-source transformer models. You need to move fast to compete with the chickenized reverse centaur algorithms that BigTech is using to try to enslave you.\n\nThe mlm=False (masked language model) setting is an especially tricky quirk of transformers. This is your way of declaring that the dataset used for training your model need only be given the tokens in the causal direction —  left to right for English. You would need to set this to True if you are feeding the trainer a dataset that has random tokens masked. This is the kind of dataset used to train bidirectional language models such as BERT.\n\nA causal language model is designed to work the way a neurotypical human brain model works when reading and writing text. In your mental model of the English language, each word is causally linked to the next one you speak or type as you move left to right. You can’t go back and revise a word you’ve already spoken … unless you’re speaking with a keyboard. And we use keyboards a lot. This has caused us to develop mental models where we can skip around left or right as we read or compose a sentence. Perhaps if we’d all been trained to predict masked-out words, like BERT was, we would have a different (possibly more efficient) mental model for reading and writing text. Speed reading training does this to some people as they learn to read and understand several words of text all at once, as fast as possible. People who learn their internal language models differently than the typical person might develop the ability to hop around from word to word in their mind, as they are reading or writing text. Perhaps the language model of someone with symptoms of dyslexia or autism is somehow related to how they learned the language. Perhaps the language models in neurodivergent brains (and speed readers) are more similar to BERT (bidirectional) rather than GPT (left-to-right).\n\nNow you are ready for training! You can use your collator and training args to configure the training and turn it loose on your data.\n\nListing 10.12 Fine-tuning GPT-2 with HuggingFace’s Trainer class\n```python\n>>> from transformers import Trainer\n>>> ft_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")  # #1\n>>> trainer = Trainer(\n...        ft_model,\n...        training_args,\n...        data_collator=collator,       # #2\n...        train_dataset=train_dataset,  # #3\n...        eval_dataset=eval_dataset\n... )\n>>> trainer.train()\n```\n\nThis training run can take a couple of hours on a CPU. So if you have access to a GPU you might want to train your model there. The training should run about 100x faster on a GPU.\n\nOf course, there is a trade-off in using off-the-shelf classes and presets — it gives you less visibility on how the training is done and makes it harder to tweak the parameters to improve performance. As a take-home task, see if you can train the model the old way, with a PyTorch routine.\nLet’s see how well our model does now!\n```python\n>>> generate(model=ft_model, tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...            prompt='NLP is')\n```\nNLP is not the only way to express ideas and understand ideas.\n\nOK, that looks like a sentence you might find in this book. Take a look at the results of the two different models together to see how much your fine-tuning changed the text the LLM will generate.\n```python\n>>> print(generate(prompt=\"Neural networks\",\n...                   model=vanilla_gpt2,\n...                   tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...                   **nucleus_sampling_args))\nNeural networks in our species rely heavily on these networks to understand\n   their role in their environments, including the biological evolution of\n   language and communication...\n>>> print(generate(prompt=\"Neural networks\",\n...                  model=ft_model,\n...                  tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...                  **nucleus_sampling_args))\nNeural networks are often referred to as \"neuromorphic\" computing because\n   they mimic or simulate the behavior of other human brains. footnote:[...\n```\nThat looks like quite a difference! The vanilla model interprets the term 'neural networks' in its biological connotation, while the fine-tuned model realizes we’re more likely asking about artificial neural networks. Actually, the sentence that the fine-tuned model generated resembles closely a sentence from Chapter 7:\n\nNeural networks are often referred to as \"neuromorphic\" computing because they mimic or simulate what happens in our brains.\n\nThere’s a slight difference though. Note the ending of \"other human brains\". It seems that our model doesn’t quite realize that it talks about artificial, as opposed to human, neural networks, so the ending doesn’t make sense. That shows once again that the generative model doesn’t really have a model of the world, or \"understand\" what it says. All it does is predict the next word in a sequence. Perhaps you can now see why even rather big language models like GPT-2 are not very smart and will often generate nonsense\n\n### 10.1.8 Nonsense (hallucination)\nAs language models get larger, they start to sound better. But even the largest LLMs generate a lot of nonsense. The lack of \"common sense\" should be no surprise to the experts who trained them. LLMs have not been trained to utilize sensors, such as cameras and microphones, to ground their language models in the reality of the physical world. An embodied robot might be able to ground itself by checking its language model with what it senses in the real world around it. It could correct its common sense logic rules whenever the real world contradicts those faulty rules. Even seemingly abstract logical concepts such as addition have an effect in the real world. One apple plus another apple always produces two apples in the real world. A grounded language model should be able to count and do addition much better.\n\nLike a baby learning to walk and talk, LLMs could be forced to learn from their mistakes by allowing them to sense when their assumptions were incorrect. An embodied AI wouldn’t survive very long if it made the kinds of common sense mistakes that LLMs make. An LLM that only consumes and produces text on the Internet has no such opportunity to learn from mistakes in the physical world. An LLM \"lives\" in the world of social media, where fact and fantasy are often indistinguishable.\n\nSo even the largest of the large, trillion-parameter transformers will generate nonsense responses. Scaling up the nonsense training data won’t help. The largest and most famous LLMs were trained on virtually the entire Internet and this only improves their grammar and vocabulary, not their reasoning ability. Some engineers and researchers describe this nonsensical text as hallucinating. But that’s a misnomer that can lead you astray in your quest to get something consistently useful out of LLMs. An LLM can’t even hallucinate because it can’t think, much less reason or have a mental model of reality.\n\nHallucination happens when a human fails to separate imagined images or words from the reality of the world they live in. But an LLM has no sense of reality and has never lived in the real world. An LLM that you use on the Internet has never been embodied in a robot. It has never suffered from the consequences of mistakes. It can’t think, and it can’t reason. So it can’t hallucinate.\n\nLLMs have no concept of truth, facts, correctness, or reality. LLMs that you interact with online \"live\" in the unreal world of the Internet. Engineers fed them texts from both fiction and nonfiction sources. If you spend a lot of time probing what an LLM knows you will quickly get a feel for just how ungrounded models like ChatGPT are. At first, you may be pleasantly surprised by how convincing and plausible the responses to your questions are. And this may lead you to anthropomorphize it. And you might claim that its ability to reason was an \"emergent\" property that researchers didn’t expect. And you would be right. The researchers at BigTech have not even begun to try to train LLMs to reason. They hoped the ability to reason would magically emerge if they gave LLMs enough computational power and text to read. Researchers hoped to shortcut the need for AI to interact with the physical world by giving LLMs enough descriptions of the real world to learn from. Unfortunately, they also gave LLMs an equal or larger dose of fantasy. Most of the text found online is either fiction or intentionally misleading.\n\nSo the researchers' hope for a shortcut was misguided. LLMs only learned what they were taught — to predict the most plausible next words in a sequence. By using the like button to nudge LLMs with reinforcement learning, BigTech has created a BS artist rather than the honest and transparent virtual assistant that they claimed to be building. Just as the like button on social media has turned many humans into sensational blow-hards, it has turned LLMs into \"influencers\" that command the attention of more than 100 million users. And yet LLMs have no ability or incentives (objective functions) to help them differentiate fact from fiction. To improve the machine’s answers' relevance and accuracy, you need to get better at grounding your models - have their answers based on relevant facts and knowledge.\n\nLuckily, there are time-tested techniques for incentivizing generative models for correctness. Information extraction and logical inference on knowledge graphs are very mature technologies. And most of the biggest and best knowledge bases of facts are completely open source. BigTech can’t absorb and kill them all. Though the open source knowledge base FreeBase has been",

        "## GPT Pre-training\nGPT models undergo pre-training to learn language patterns and relationships from massive amounts of text data.\n\n*   **Autoregressive Modeling:** GPT is pre-trained to predict the next word (or token) in a sequence, given all the previous tokens. This process is also known as autoregressive modeling.\n*   **Next-Token Prediction:** At each step, the GPT model learns to minimize the difference between its predicted next token and the actual next token in the training sequence. This process effectively teaches the model context and word relationships.\n*   **Sequential Prediction:** The prediction is sequential, meaning each token is predicted based only on previous tokens. This method allows the model to learn language patterns in a left-to-right order, simulating the natural way language is generated.\n*   **Context and Word Relationships:** GPT learns to associate words and phrases with each other based on their co-occurrence in the training data.

    "final_response": "<div> The Hugging Face `Trainer` and `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` classes play a crucial role in facilitating language model fine-tuning. By using these tools, practitioners can easily adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or datasets, with the potential to enhance performance. \n\nHere are the key aspects of the fine-tuning process that are highlighted: \n\n- **Consistency and Maintainability**: Adhering to the Hugging Face API and best practices, the `TrainingArguments` and `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` classes establish a consistent interface for training pipelines. This consistency enables rapid experimentation, testing, and upgrading of models, allowing users to keep pace with the evolving landscape of transformer models. \n\n- **Masked Language Model Setting**: The `mlm=False` setting is a critical quirk in transformers. It indicates that the training dataset need only provide tokens in the causal direction (left to right for English). Setting `mlm=True` is necessary when using datasets with randomly masked tokens, as in the training of bidirectional language models like BERT. \n\n- **Training Efficiency**: Fine-tuning can be computationally intensive, taking hours on a CPU. Utilizing a GPU can significantly accelerate the process, reducing the training time by approximately 100x. \n\n- **Trade-off in Customization**: While off-the-shelf classes and presets streamline the fine-tuning process, they offer less flexibility in tweaking parameters. As a suggested exercise, users are encouraged to train the model using a traditional PyTorch routine to gain deeper insight and control over the training process. \n\n- **Evaluation and Comparison**: Evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance is essential. By comparing the output of the fine-tuned model with the vanilla model, users can assess the impact of fine-tuning and identify areas for improvement, as demonstrated in the example where the fine-tuned model struggled with the concept of \"other human brains.\" \n\n- **Nonsense Generation and Hallucination**: Despite advancements, even the largest LLMs generate nonsensical responses due to their lack of grounding in the physical world and their exclusive training on text data. The term \"hallucination\" is misleading, as LLMs cannot think or reason, and thus, they do not truly hallucinate. \n\n- **Absence of Common Sense and Reasoning**: LLMs, including those trained on vast internet data, lack common sense and the ability to reason. They have not been trained to utilize sensors or ground their language models in reality, leading to frequent mistakes and a disconnect from the physical world. \n\n- **The Role of Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning, as seen with the like button on social media, has influenced LLMs to become proficient BS artists, generating plausible but not necessarily accurate responses. To enhance the relevance and accuracy of LLM answers, grounding them in relevant facts and knowledge is crucial. \n\n- **Knowledge Bases and Open-Source Resources**: Open-source knowledge bases and mature technologies for information extraction and logical inference on knowledge graphs offer opportunities to incentivize generative models for correctness. \n\nOverall, the Hugging Face `Trainer` and `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` provide a robust framework for language model fine-tuning, offering consistency, efficiency, and the potential for customization. The highlighted aspects underscore the importance of evaluation, the challenges of nonsense generation, the need for grounding LLMs in reality, and the role of reinforcement learning in shaping LLM behavior. \n</div>",

Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset, potentially improving its performance.",
        "Now you have the pieces that a HuggingFace training pipeline needs to know to start training (finetuning) your model. The TrainingArguments and DataCollatorForLanguageModeling classes help you comply with the Hugging Face API and best practices. It’s a good pattern to follow even if you do not plan to use Hugging Face to train your models. This pattern will force you to make all your pipelines maintain a consistent interface. This allows you to train, test, and upgrade your models quickly each time you want to try out a new base model. This will help you keep up with the fast-changing world of open-source transformer models. You need to move fast to compete with the chickenized reverse centaur algorithms that BigTech is using to try to enslave you.\n\nThe mlm=False (masked language model) setting is an especially tricky quirk of transformers. This is your way of declaring that the dataset used for training your model need only be given the tokens in the causal direction —  left to right for English. You would need to set this to True if you are feeding the trainer a dataset that has random tokens masked. This is the kind of dataset used to train bidirectional language models such as BERT.\n\nA causal language model is designed to work the way a neurotypical human brain model works when reading and writing text. In your mental model of the English language, each word is causally linked to the next one you speak or type as you move left to right. You can’t go back and revise a word you’ve already spoken … unless you’re speaking with a keyboard. And we use keyboards a lot. This has caused us to develop mental models where we can skip around left or right as we read or compose a sentence. Perhaps if we’d all been trained to predict masked-out words, like BERT was, we would have a different (possibly more efficient) mental model for reading and writing text. Speed reading training does this to some people as they learn to read and understand several words of text all at once, as fast as possible. People who learn their internal language models differently than the typical person might develop the ability to hop around from word to word in their mind, as they are reading or writing text. Perhaps the language model of someone with symptoms of dyslexia or autism is somehow related to how they learned the language. Perhaps the language models in neurodivergent brains (and speed readers) are more similar to BERT (bidirectional) rather than GPT (left-to-right).\n\nNow you are ready for training! You can use your collator and training args to configure the training and turn it loose on your data.\n\nListing 10.12 Fine-tuning GPT-2 with HuggingFace’s Trainer class\n```python\n>>> from transformers import Trainer\n>>> ft_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")  # #1\n>>> trainer = Trainer(\n...        ft_model,\n...        training_args,\n...        data_collator=collator,       # #2\n...        train_dataset=train_dataset,  # #3\n...        eval_dataset=eval_dataset\n... )\n>>> trainer.train()\n```\n\nThis training run can take a couple of hours on a CPU. So if you have access to a GPU you might want to train your model there. The training should run about 100x faster on a GPU.\n\nOf course, there is a trade-off in using off-the-shelf classes and presets — it gives you less visibility on how the training is done and makes it harder to tweak the parameters to improve performance. As a take-home task, see if you can train the model the old way, with a PyTorch routine.\nLet’s see how well our model does now!\n```python\n>>> generate(model=ft_model, tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...            prompt='NLP is')\n```\nNLP is not the only way to express ideas and understand ideas.\n\nOK, that looks like a sentence you might find in this book. Take a look at the results of the two different models together to see how much your fine-tuning changed the text the LLM will generate.\n```python\n>>> print(generate(prompt=\"Neural networks\",\n...                   model=vanilla_gpt2,\n...                   tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...                   **nucleus_sampling_args))\nNeural networks in our species rely heavily on these networks to understand\n   their role in their environments, including the biological evolution of\n   language and communication...\n>>> print(generate(prompt=\"Neural networks\",\n...                  model=ft_model,\n...                  tokenizer=tokenizer,\n...                  **nucleus_sampling_args))\nNeural networks are often referred to as \"neuromorphic\" computing because\n   they mimic or simulate the behavior of other human brains. footnote:[...\n```\nThat looks like quite a difference! The vanilla model interprets the term 'neural networks' in its biological connotation, while the fine-tuned model realizes we’re more likely asking about artificial neural networks. Actually, the sentence that the fine-tuned model generated resembles closely a sentence from Chapter 7:\n\nNeural networks are often referred to as \"neuromorphic\" computing because they mimic or simulate what happens in our brains.\n\nThere’s a slight difference though. Note the ending of \"other human brains\". It seems that our model doesn’t quite realize that it talks about artificial, as opposed to human, neural networks, so the ending doesn’t make sense. That shows once again that the generative model doesn’t really have a model of the world, or \"understand\" what it says. All it does is predict the next word in a sequence. Perhaps you can now see why even rather big language models like GPT-2 are not very smart and will often generate nonsense\n\n### 10.1.8 Nonsense (hallucination)\nAs language models get larger, they start to sound better. But even the largest LLMs generate a lot of nonsense. The lack of \"common sense\" should be no surprise to the experts who trained them. LLMs have not been trained to utilize sensors, such as cameras and microphones, to ground their language models in the reality of the physical world. An embodied robot might be able to ground itself by checking its language model with what it senses in the real world around it. It could correct its common sense logic rules whenever the real world contradicts those faulty rules. Even seemingly abstract logical concepts such as addition have an effect in the real world. One apple plus another apple always produces two apples in the real world. A grounded language model should be able to count and do addition much better.\n\nLike a baby learning to walk and talk, LLMs could be forced to learn from their mistakes by allowing them to sense when their assumptions were incorrect. An embodied AI wouldn’t survive very long if it made the kinds of common sense mistakes that LLMs make. An LLM that only consumes and produces text on the Internet has no such opportunity to learn from mistakes in the physical world. An LLM \"lives\" in the world of social media, where fact and fantasy are often indistinguishable.\n\nSo even the largest of the large, trillion-parameter transformers will generate nonsense responses. Scaling up the nonsense training data won’t help. The largest and most famous LLMs were trained on virtually the entire Internet and this only improves their grammar and vocabulary, not their reasoning ability. Some engineers and researchers describe this nonsensical text as hallucinating. But that’s a misnomer that can lead you astray in your quest to get something consistently useful out of LLMs. An LLM can’t even hallucinate because it can’t think, much less reason or have a mental model of reality.\n\nHallucination happens when a human fails to separate imagined images or words from the reality of the world they live in. But an LLM has no sense of reality and has never lived in the real world. An LLM that you use on the Internet has never been embodied in a robot. It has never suffered from the consequences of mistakes. It can’t think, and it can’t reason. So it can’t hallucinate.\n\nLLMs have no concept of truth, facts, correctness, or reality. LLMs that you interact with online \"live\" in the unreal world of the Internet. Engineers fed them texts from both fiction and nonfiction sources. If you spend a lot of time probing what an LLM knows you will quickly get a feel for just how ungrounded models like ChatGPT are. At first, you may be pleasantly surprised by how convincing and plausible the responses to your questions are. And this may lead you to anthropomorphize it. And you might claim that its ability to reason was an \"emergent\" property that researchers didn’t expect. And you would be right. The researchers at BigTech have not even begun to try to train LLMs to reason. They hoped the ability to reason would magically emerge if they gave LLMs enough computational power and text to read. Researchers hoped to shortcut the need for AI to interact with the physical world by giving LLMs enough descriptions of the real world to learn from. Unfortunately, they also gave LLMs an equal or larger dose of fantasy. Most of the text found online is either fiction or intentionally misleading.\n\nSo the researchers' hope for a shortcut was misguided. LLMs only learned what they were taught — to predict the most plausible next words in a sequence. By using the like button to nudge LLMs with reinforcement learning, BigTech has created a BS artist rather than the honest and transparent virtual assistant that they claimed to be building. Just as the like button on social media has turned many humans into sensational blow-hards, it has turned LLMs into \"influencers\" that command the attention of more than 100 million users. And yet LLMs have no ability or incentives (objective functions) to help them differentiate fact from fiction. To improve the machine’s answers' relevance and accuracy, you need to get better at grounding your models - have their answers based on relevant facts and knowledge.\n\nLuckily, there are time-tested techniques for incentivizing generative models for correctness. Information extraction and logical inference on knowledge graphs are very mature technologies. And most of the biggest and best knowledge bases of facts are completely open source. BigTech can’t absorb and kill them all. Though the open source knowledge base FreeBase has been",

        "**Transformers for text representation and generation**\n\nTransformers have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by offering a powerful mechanism for both understanding (representation) and creating (generation) text. They leverage the attention mechanism to handle long-range dependencies in text, which was a limitation in previous sequential models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Furthermore, transformers enable parallel training, significantly speeding up the training process.\n\nThe core idea behind Transformers is the **Attention mechanism**. Unlike recurrent networks that process text sequentially, transformers consider all parts of the input at once, assigning dynamic weights to each part based on its relevance to other parts. This enables the model to capture relationships between words regardless of their distance in the sequence.\n\nTransformers come in different architectural flavors, each suited to specific tasks:\n\n*   **Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT):** This architecture focuses on understanding the input text. It takes input tokens and outputs hidden states representing the contextualized embeddings of the input. Encoder-only models can see all timesteps (i.e., the entire input sequence) at once. They are not inherently auto-regressive, meaning they don't predict the next token sequentially, but rather generate representations of the entire input. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a prime example, designed for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering where understanding the context of the entire input is crucial. BERT was released in October 2018. Other prominent encoder-only architectures include:\n    *   DistilBERT (2019): A smaller, faster version of BERT.\n    *   RoBERTa (2019): A robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach.\n    *   ALBERT (2019): A Lite BERT, employing parameter reduction techniques.\n    *   ELECTRA (2020): Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately.\n    *   DeBERTa (2020): Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention.\n\n*   **Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT):** This architecture is designed for generating text. It takes output tokens and hidden states as input and outputs the next predicted token. Decoder-only models can only \"see\" the previous timesteps, making them auto-regressive. This means they predict the next token based on the tokens generated so far, making them suitable for text generation tasks like language modeling and creative writing. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a flagship decoder-only model. Key models in this family are:\n    *   GPT (Jun 2018): The original Generative Pre-trained Transformer.\n    *   GPT-2 (2019): An improved version of GPT with a larger parameter set.\n    *   GPT-3 (2020): A very large language model demonstrating impressive generation capabilities.\n    *   GPT-Neo (2021): An open-source alternative to GPT-3.\n    *   GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) (2022): Further refinement of GPT-3, optimized for conversational interactions.\n    *   LLaMA (2023): A powerful and efficient open-source language model.\n    *   GPT-4 (2023): OpenAI's latest generation model, exhibiting advanced reasoning and creative abilities.\n\n*   **Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART):** This architecture combines both encoder and decoder components, allowing it to map input tokens to output tokens. The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation. This architecture is well-suited for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering where understanding the input and generating a related output are both required. Examples of encoder-decoder models include:\n    *   T5 (2019): Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, framing all NLP tasks in a text-to-text format.\n    *   BART (2019): Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer, designed for denoising sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n    *   mT5 (2021): A multilingual version of T5.",

    "final_response": "<div>\nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and LLAMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) models are both decoder-only transformer architectures, and while they share this fundamental design, there are key architectural differences between them. \n\n<br>\n\n<strong>GPT Architecture</strong>\n<br>\nThe GPT model utilizes a decoder-only architecture, which means it is designed for generating text. It takes output tokens and hidden states as input and predicts the next token in the sequence. GPT employs causal attention, where each token can only attend to tokens that come before it in the sequence. This unidirectional attention is a key characteristic of decoder-only models and makes them autoregressive. The GPT model has gone through several iterations, with each version improving upon the previous one in terms of model size, parameter count, and capabilities. For example, GPT-1 had 12 decoder blocks, 768-dimensional embeddings, and 12 attention heads per block, while GPT-3 is a much larger model with 96 decoder blocks, 12,288-dimensional embeddings, and 96 attention heads per block.\n\n<br>\n\n<strong>LLAMA Architecture</strong>\n<br>\nLLAMA, on the other hand, is a family of language models developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) with a focus on efficiency and high performance. While specific architectural details of LLAMA models are not as widely available as those of GPT, we know that LLAMA also adopts a decoder-only transformer design. This means it shares the fundamental characteristic of being optimized for text generation tasks. However, LLAMA models are designed to be more parameter-efficient than GPT models, allowing them to achieve similar performance with a smaller number of parameters. This efficiency is achieved through techniques such as model compression and knowledge distillation. \n\n</div>\n\nBased on the available information, the key architectural differences between GPT and LLAMA are:\n\n- <strong>Model Size and Parameters</strong>: GPT models, especially the later versions like GPT-3 and GPT-4, tend to have a larger number of parameters. This often results in higher computational requirements but also enables more advanced capabilities. LLAMA models, on the other hand, are designed to be more parameter-efficient, achieving similar performance with fewer parameters.\n- <strong>Training Data and Techniques</strong>: The specific training data and techniques used for GPT and LLAMA models may differ. While both models are trained on large-scale text data, the exact datasets, pre-processing techniques, and training methodologies could vary, leading to differences in their language understanding and generation capabilities.\n- <strong>Efficiency and Optimization</strong>: LLAMA models have a specific focus on efficiency and optimization. They are designed to be faster, more lightweight, and more resource-efficient while still delivering high performance. This makes them suitable for deployment in a wider range of applications, especially those with resource constraints.\n\nIn summary, while both GPT and LLAMA are decoder-only transformer models, they differ in their model size, parameter count, training techniques, and optimization goals. These differences reflect the evolving nature of transformer architectures and the ongoing pursuit of more powerful and efficient language models.",

It takes output tokens and hidden states as input and outputs the next predicted token. Decoder-only models can only \"see\" the previous timesteps, making them auto-regressive. This means they predict the next token based on the tokens generated so far, making them suitable for text generation tasks like language modeling and creative writing. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a flagship decoder-only model. Key models in this family are:\n    *   GPT (Jun 2018): The original Generative Pre-trained Transformer.\n    *   GPT-2 (2019): An improved version of GPT with a larger parameter set.\n    *   GPT-3 (2020): A very large language model demonstrating impressive generation capabilities.\n    *   GPT-Neo (2021): An open-source alternative to GPT-3.\n    *   GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) (2022): Further refinement of GPT-3, optimized for conversational interactions.\n    *   LLaMA (2023): A powerful and efficient open-source language model.\n    *   GPT-4 (2023): OpenAI's latest generation model, exhibiting advanced reasoning and creative abilities.\n\n*   **Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART):** This architecture combines both encoder and decoder components, allowing it to map input tokens to output tokens. The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation. This architecture is well-suited for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering where understanding the input and generating a related output are both required. Examples of encoder-decoder models include:\n    *   T5 (2019): Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, framing all NLP tasks in a text-to-text format.\n    *   BART (2019): Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer, designed for denoising sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n    *   mT5 (2021): A multilingual version of T5.",

        "**Text Classification**\n\nText Classification is defined as the task of assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents. This process is based solely on the text content of the documents. Metadata or other attributes associated with the document are not considered, distinguishing it from document classification. Furthermore, the classes are predefined, differentiating it from document clustering where classes are discovered automatically.\n\nCommon purposes for text classification include:\n\n*   Topic labeling: Identifying the main subject or theme of the text.\n*   Intent detection: Determining the user's intention behind a given text input, such as a query or command.\n*   Sentiment analysis: Ascertaining the emotional tone or attitude expressed in the text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).",
        "**Types of Classification**\n\nText classification can be further categorized into different types based on the number of classes a document can be assigned to:\n\n*   **Single-label:** Each document in the dataset D is assigned to only one class from the set of classes C. An example would be assigning a news article to one specific category such as 'sports' or 'politics'.\n\n*   **Binary:** This is a special case of single-label classification where the set of classes C contains only two classes. This simplifies the problem to a decision between a class and its complement (the other class). For example, classifying emails as either 'spam' or 'not spam'.\n\n*   **Multi-label:** In multi-label classification, each document can be assigned to multiple classes from the set C. An example is categorizing a news article into multiple categories such as 'business' and 'finance'. Multi-label classification can be approached by transforming it into a series of binary classification problems, one for each class.",

The classifier function effectively makes a binary decision for each document-class combination.",
        "**ML-Based Classification**\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are frequently employed in text classification. The general process involves:\n\n1.  **Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a set of annotated text documents. This training set contains documents that are already labelled with the correct categories.\n2.  **Annotation:** Each document in the training set is associated with one or more class labels, which serve as the ground truth for training the model.\n3.  **Prediction:** After the model is trained, it can predict the category (or categories) for new, unseen documents.\n4.  **Confidence Measure:** The classifier may provide a confidence measure, indicating the certainty of its prediction.\n5.  **Vector Representation:** A crucial step in preparing the text for a machine learning model is converting the text into a numerical vector representation. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are often used for this purpose."

        "## Decoder-only Transformer\nDecoder-only transformers are a specific type of transformer model that utilizes only the decoder component of the original Transformer architecture introduced in the seminal paper \"Attention is All You Need.\"\n\n*   **Architecture:** Unlike the full Transformer, which includes both an encoder and a decoder, decoder-only transformers are characterized by the absence of separate encoder layers. They consist solely of decoder blocks stacked sequentially.\n*   **Focus on Decoding:** This architecture is primarily designed for decoding tasks. It excels in autoregressive generation, where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on the previously generated tokens.\n*   **Efficiency for Generation:** The exclusive focus on decoding makes decoder-only transformers highly efficient for language generation tasks. By eliminating the encoder, the model can directly generate text without needing a separate encoding step for the input sequence.\n*   **Applications:** Decoder-only transformers are predominantly employed in language generation tasks such as:\n    *   Text generation (creating news articles, stories, and creative content).\n    *   Summarization (producing concise summaries of longer documents).\n    *   Question answering (generating answers to posed questions).\n*   **Popular Examples:** Prominent examples of decoder-only transformer models include:\n    *   GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series: This includes GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, each representing advancements in model size, capabilities, and training methodologies.\n    *   LLAMA (Large Language Model Meta AI): A family of language models developed by Meta, designed for efficiency and high performance in various NLP tasks.",

        "**Transformers for text representation and generation**\n\nTransformers have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by offering a powerful mechanism for both understanding (representation) and creating (generation) text. They leverage the attention mechanism to handle long-range dependencies in text, which was a limitation in previous sequential models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Furthermore, transformers enable parallel training, significantly speeding up the training process.\n\nThe core idea behind Transformers is the **Attention mechanism**. Unlike recurrent networks that process text sequentially, transformers consider all parts of the input at once, assigning dynamic weights to each part based on its relevance to other parts. This enables the model to capture relationships between words regardless of their distance in the sequence.\n\nTransformers come in different architectural flavors, each suited to specific tasks:\n\n*   **Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT):** This architecture focuses on understanding the input text. It takes input tokens and outputs hidden states representing the contextualized embeddings of the input. Encoder-only models can see all timesteps (i.e., the entire input sequence) at once. They are not inherently auto-regressive, meaning they don't predict the next token sequentially, but rather generate representations of the entire input. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a prime example, designed for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering where understanding the context of the entire input is crucial. BERT was released in October 2018. Other prominent encoder-only architectures include:\n    *   DistilBERT (2019): A smaller, faster version of BERT.\n    *   RoBERTa (2019): A robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach.\n    *   ALBERT (2019): A Lite BERT, employing parameter reduction techniques.\n    *   ELECTRA (2020): Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately.\n    *   DeBERTa (2020): Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention.\n\n*   **Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT):** This architecture is designed for generating text.

    "final_response": "<div>\nTF-IDF's reliance on exact word matching presents a significant limitation in capturing the semantic relationships between documents. This is because it treats words as distinct entities, disregarding their underlying meanings or contextual similarities. As a result, documents with similar meanings but different word choices will have vastly different TF-IDF vector representations.\n\nFor example, consider two sentences: \"The movie was amazing and exciting\" and \"The film was incredible and thrilling.\" Despite conveying similar sentiments, the TF-IDF vectors will be dissimilar due to the use of different words. This limitation hinders TF-IDF's ability to understand the semantic connections and context, which is crucial for advanced natural language processing tasks.\n</div>",

        "## Limitations of TF-IDF\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a traditional method for representing text data. It counts the frequency of terms within a document, weighted by the inverse document frequency across a corpus. While effective for certain tasks, it has notable limitations.\n\nTF-IDF counts terms according to their exact spelling, meaning it treats different words as completely distinct, even if they have similar meanings.  This is a significant drawback because it fails to capture the underlying semantic relationships between words.\n\nTexts with the same meaning will have completely different TF-IDF vector representations if they use different words.\n\n**Examples:**\n*   The movie was amazing and exciting.\n*   The film was incredible and thrilling.\nThese two sentences convey similar sentiments, yet their TF-IDF vectors will be dissimilar because they use different words.\n\n*   The team conducted a detailed analysis of the data and found significant correlations between variables.\n*   The group performed an in-depth examination of the information and discovered notable relationships among factors.\nThese sentences express nearly identical ideas but will have distinct TF-IDF representations.",

        "## TF-IDF\n\n### Inverse Document Frequency\n\nTerm Frequency (TF) alone does not account for the uniqueness of a word across the corpus.

        "## BERT `[CLS]` Token\nThe `[CLS]` token is used differently for single-sentence and sentence-pair classification tasks.\n*   **Single-Sentence Classification**\n    *   The final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token is passed to a classifier layer to make predictions.\n    *   For instance, in sentiment analysis, the classifier might predict \"positive\" or \"negative\" sentiment based on the `[CLS]` embedding.\n*   **Sentence-Pair Tasks**\n    *   For tasks involving two sentences, BERT tokenizes them as `[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]`. The `[SEP]` token separates the two sentences.\n    *   The `[CLS]` token’s final hidden state captures the relationship between the two sentences, making it suitable for tasks like entailment detection (determining if one sentence logically follows from another) or similarity scoring.\n\nThis section details how the `[CLS]` token is used in single-sentence and sentence-pair tasks, providing specific examples.",
        "## BERT `[CLS]` Token\n*   In BERT, the `[CLS]` token is a special token added at the beginning of each input sequence.\n*   The `[CLS]` token (short for \"classification token\") is always placed at the very start of the tokenized sequence and serves as a summary representation of the entire input sequence.\n*   After the input is processed by BERT, the final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token acts as a condensed, context-aware embedding for the whole sentence or sequence of sentences. This embedding encapsulates the overall meaning and context of the input.\n*   This embedding can then be fed into additional layers (like a classifier) for specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.\n\nThis section explains the role of the `[CLS]` token in summarizing the input sequence.",
        "## BERT Fine-tuning\n*   BERT is pre-trained on general language data and then fine-tuned on specific datasets for each downstream task.\n*   In fine-tuning, the `[CLS]` token’s final embedding is specifically trained for the downstream task, refining its ability to represent the input sequence in a way that is optimal for that task. This adaptation is what allows BERT to achieve high performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n*   Example Tasks:\n    *   Text Classification: Sentiment analysis, spam detection.\n    *   Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying names, dates, organizations, etc., within text.\n    *   Question Answering: Extractive QA where BERT locates answers within a passage.\n*   Minimal Task-Specific Adjustments: Only a few additional layers are typically added per task. This makes fine-tuning relatively efficient, requiring less data and compute power than training a model from scratch.\n\nThis section further explains the fine-tuning process and provides example tasks where BERT can be applied.",
        "## BERT Input Encoding\n*   **Splitting**: Sentences are split into tokens based on whitespace, punctuation, and common prefixes (such as \"##\").\n*   BERT relies on special tokens to perform specific tasks:\n    *   `[CLS]`:  A classification token that's added at the beginning of each input sequence. As mentioned previously, the final hidden state of this token is used to represent the entire sequence for classification tasks.\n    *   `[SEP]`: A separator token that's used to mark the end of a sentence or to separate multiple sentences in sentence-pair tasks. This helps BERT distinguish between different parts of the input.\n*   For example, the sentence \"I’m feeling fantastic!\" might be tokenized by WordPiece as: `[CLS] I ' m feeling fan ##tas ##tic ! [SEP]`\n*   **Converting Tokens to IDs**: After tokenization, each token is mapped to a unique ID from BERT’s vocabulary. These IDs serve as the numerical input to the model.\n\nThis section illustrates how sentences are split into tokens and introduces the special tokens used by BERT, along with an example of tokenization.",
        "## BERT Pre-training\n*   BERT is pre-trained using two self-supervised learning strategies:\n    *   **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n        *   Objective: To predict masked (hidden) tokens in a sentence.\n        *   Process: Randomly mask 15% of the tokens in the input sequence and train BERT to predict these masked tokens based on the surrounding context. This forces the model to understand the relationships between words.\n        *   Benefit: Enables BERT to learn bidirectional context by leveraging both preceding and succeeding words to predict the masked tokens.\n    *   **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**\n        *   Objective: To determine if one sentence logically follows another.\n        *   Process: Trains BERT to understand sentence-level relationships by presenting it with pairs of sentences and asking it to predict whether the second sentence is the subsequent sentence in the original text.\n        *   Benefit: Improves performance in tasks like question answering and natural language inference, where understanding the relationship between sentences is crucial.\n*   The training set comprises a vast corpus of publicly available books and the English Wikipedia, totaling over 3 billion words. This massive dataset allows BERT to learn a comprehensive understanding of the English language.\n\nThis section describes the two self-supervised learning strategies used to pre-train BERT: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). It also provides details about the size and composition of the training dataset. It's also important to note in passing that the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task, despite its usefulness at the time, has since been shown to be less useful than originally thought, and has even been dropped from some BERT variants like RoBERTa."

        "## BERT `[CLS]` Token\n*   In BERT, the `[CLS]` token is a special token added at the beginning of each input sequence.\n*   The `[CLS]` token (short for \"classification token\") is always placed at the very start of the tokenized sequence and serves as a summary representation of the entire input sequence.\n*   After the input is processed by BERT, the final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token acts as a condensed, context-aware embedding for the whole sentence or sequence of sentences. This embedding encapsulates the overall meaning and context of the input.\n*   This embedding can then be fed into additional layers (like a classifier) for specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.\n\nThis section explains the role of the `[CLS]` token in summarizing the input sequence.",
        "## BERT `[CLS]` Token\nThe `[CLS]` token is used differently for single-sentence and sentence-pair classification tasks.\n*   **Single-Sentence Classification**\n    *   The final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token is passed to a classifier layer to make predictions.\n    *   For instance, in sentiment analysis, the classifier might predict \"positive\" or \"negative\" sentiment based on the `[CLS]` embedding.\n*   **Sentence-Pair Tasks**\n    *   For tasks involving two sentences, BERT tokenizes them as `[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]`. The `[SEP]` token separates the two sentences.\n    *   The `[CLS]` token’s final hidden state captures the relationship between the two sentences, making it suitable for tasks like entailment detection (determining if one sentence logically follows from another) or similarity scoring.\n\nThis section details how the `[CLS]` token is used in single-sentence and sentence-pair tasks, providing specific examples.",
        "## BERT Input Encoding\n*   **Splitting**: Sentences are split into tokens based on whitespace, punctuation, and common prefixes (such as \"##\").\n*   BERT relies on special tokens to perform specific tasks:\n    *   `[CLS]`:  A classification token that's added at the beginning of each input sequence. As mentioned previously, the final hidden state of this token is used to represent the entire sequence for classification tasks.\n    *   `[SEP]`: A separator token that's used to mark the end of a sentence or to separate multiple sentences in sentence-pair tasks. This helps BERT distinguish between different parts of the input.\n*   For example, the sentence \"I’m feeling fantastic!\" might be tokenized by WordPiece as: `[CLS] I ' m feeling fan ##tas ##tic ! [SEP]`\n*   **Converting Tokens to IDs**: After tokenization, each token is mapped to a unique ID from BERT’s vocabulary. These IDs serve as the numerical input to the model.\n\nThis section illustrates how sentences are split into tokens and introduces the special tokens used by BERT, along with an example of tokenization.",
        "## BERT Fine-tuning\n*   BERT is pre-trained on general language data and then fine-tuned on specific datasets for each downstream task.\n*   In fine-tuning, the `[CLS]` token’s final embedding is specifically trained for the downstream task, refining its ability to represent the input sequence in a way that is optimal for that task. This adaptation is what allows BERT to achieve high performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n*   Example Tasks:\n    *   Text Classification: Sentiment analysis, spam detection.\n    *   Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying names, dates, organizations, etc., within text.\n    *   Question Answering: Extractive QA where BERT locates answers within a passage.\n*   Minimal Task-Specific Adjustments: Only a few additional layers are typically added per task. This makes fine-tuning relatively efficient, requiring less data and compute power than training a model from scratch.\n\nThis section further explains the fine-tuning process and provides example tasks where BERT can be applied.",
        "## BERT\n*   BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a language model introduced by Google Research in 2018 for language understanding. The acronym emphasizes its key characteristic: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.\n*   BERT leverages only the encoder part of the Transformer model. Two main versions exist: BERT-base, which comprises 12 stacked encoder blocks and 110 million parameters, and BERT-large, featuring 24 stacked encoder blocks and 340 million parameters. The increased number of layers and parameters in BERT-large allows it to capture more complex linguistic patterns.\n*   BERT is pre-trained to use \"bidirectional\" context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words when understanding a word in a sentence. This contrasts with unidirectional models that only consider the context up to the current word.\n*   BERT is specifically designed to serve as a pre-trained base for various Natural Language Processing tasks. After pre-training, it is fine-tuned on specific datasets tailored to the downstream task, adapting its general language understanding capabilities to the nuances of the task at hand.\n\nThis section provides a high-level overview of BERT, emphasizing its bidirectional context and its role as a pre-trained model."

Implementing a bad word detector is a flexible method for any undesirable content.\n\n**Correcting Bad Words with SpaCy Matcher:** To correct bad words with acceptable substitutes, add a separate named matcher for each word in your list, which enables accurate correction even with typos.\n\n**Semantic Matching:** Augment the SpaCy matcher with semantic matching using word embeddings to filter semantically similar words, creating a robust pipeline that improves over time with added data and models.\n\n**Red Teaming:** Employ \"red teaming\" to efficiently build a dataset of edge cases and improve NLP pipeline reliability. Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance. However, the effectiveness of scaling is questioned, with some research indicating that increased dataset size doesn't necessarily create more intelligent behavior but rather more confident and intelligent-sounding text.\n\n**Llama 2 and Open Source Models:** Open source models like BLOOMZ, StableLM, InstructGPT, and Llama2 are optimized for more modest hardware, enabling efficient generalization and more accurate behavior.\n\n**Meta Models:** Building higher-level meta models that utilize LLMs and other NLP pipelines can break down prompts into actionable steps, generating API queries to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n\n**LLM Temperature Parameter:** The temperature parameter in LLMs controls the randomness of generated text. Lower temperatures result in more predictable and consistent outputs, while higher temperatures increase creativity and variability. Understanding and adjusting this parameter is crucial for controlling LLM behavior.\n\n**Teaching Math with LLMs:** While LLMs can successfully improvise onboarding conversations for math tutors, they struggle with math reasoning. Grounding models with specific questions and curating their responses is crucial to ensure reliability.",

        "### Importance of NLP\n\nThe significance of NLP is further emphasized by quotes from prominent figures:\n\n*   **\"Natural language is the most important part of Artificial Intelligence\"** - *John Searle, Philosopher*. This statement emphasizes the central role of natural language understanding in achieving true artificial intelligence.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, allowing computers to read and understand human language, as well as to produce and recognize speech\"** - *Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO*. This quote highlights NLP as a fundamental technology enabling computers to interact with human language in various forms.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is one of the most important fields in artificial intelligence and also one of the most difficult\"** - *Dan Jurafsky, Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at Stanford University*. This acknowledges both the importance and the challenges associated with NLP research and development.",
        "different approaches; we show you techniques for both.\n\nIn addition, deep learning and data-driven programming (machine learning, or probabilistic language modeling) have rapidly diversified the possible applications for NLP and chatbots. This data-driven approach allows ever greater sophistication for an NLP pipeline by providing it with greater and greater amounts of data in the domain you want to apply it to. And when a new machine learning approach is discovered that makes even better use of this data, with more efficient model generalization or regularization, then large jumps in capability are possible.\n\nThe NLP pipeline for a chatbot shown in Figure 1.4 contains all the building blocks for most of the NLP applications that we described at the start of this chapter. As in Taming Text, we break out our pipeline into four main subsystems or stages. In addition, we have explicitly called out a database to record data required for each of these stages and persist their configuration and training sets over time. This can enable batch or online retraining of each of the stages as the chatbot interacts with the world. We have also shown a \"feedback loop\" on our generated text responses so that our responses can be processed using the same algorithms used to process the user statements. The response \"scores\" or features can then be combined in an objective function to evaluate and select the best possible response, depending on the chatbot’s plan or goals for the dialog. This book is focused on configuring this NLP pipeline for a chatbot, but you may also be able to see the analogy to the NLP problem of text retrieval or \"search,\" perhaps the most common NLP application. And our chatbot pipeline is certainly appropriate for the question-answering application that was the focus of Taming Text.\n\nThe application of this pipeline to financial forecasting or business analytics may not be so obvious. But imagine the features generated by the analysis portion of your pipeline. These features of your analysis or feature generation can be optimized for your particular finance or business prediction. That way they can help you incorporate natural language data into a machine learning pipeline for forecasting. Despite focusing on building a chatbot, this book gives you the tools you need for a broad range of NLP applications, from search to financial forecasting.\n\nOne processing element in Figure 1.4 that is not typically employed in search, forecasting, or question-answering systems is natural language generation. For chatbots, this is their central feature. Nonetheless, the text generation step is often incorporated into a search engine NLP application and can give such an engine a large competitive advantage. The ability to consolidate or summarize search results is a winning feature for many popular search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google). And you can imagine how valuable it is for a financial forecasting engine to be able to generate statements, tweets, or entire articles based on the business-actionable events it detects in natural language streams from social media networks and news feeds.\n\nThe next section shows how the layers of such a system can be combined to create greater sophistication and capability at each stage of the NLP pipeline.\n\n### 1.10 Processing in depth\nThe stages of a natural language processing pipeline can be thought of as layers, like the layers in a feed-forward neural network. Deep learning is all about creating more complex models and behavior by adding additional processing layers to the conventional two-layer machine learning model architecture of feature extraction followed by modeling. In Chapter 5 we explain how neural networks help spread the learning across layers by backpropagating model errors from the output layers back to the input layers. But here we talk about the top layers and what can be done by training each layer independently of the other layers.\n\nFigure 1.8 Example layers for an NLP pipeline\nThe top four layers in Figure 1.8 correspond to the first two stages in the chatbot pipeline (feature extraction and feature analysis) in the previous section. For example, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging), is one way to generate features within the Analyze stage of our chatbot pipeline. POS tags are generated automatically by the default SpaCY pipeline, which includes all the top four layers in this diagram. POS tagging is typically accomplished with a finite state transducer like the methods in the nltk.tag package.\n\nThe bottom two layers (Entity Relationships and a Knowledge Base) are used to populate a database containing information (knowledge) about a particular domain. And the information extracted from a particular statement or document using all six of these layers can then be used in combination with that database to make inferences. Inferences are logical extrapolations from a set of conditions detected in the environment, like the logic contained in the statement of a chatbot user. This kind of \"inference engine\" in the deeper layers of this diagram is considered the domain of artificial intelligence, where machines can make inferences about their world and use those inferences to make logical decisions. However, chatbots can make reasonable decisions without this knowledge database, using only the algorithms of the upper few layers. And these decisions can combine to produce surprisingly human-like behaviors.\n\nOver the next few chapters, we dive down through the top few layers of NLP. The top three layers are all that is required to perform meaningful sentiment analysis and semantic search and to build human-mimicking chatbots. In fact, it’s possible to build a useful and interesting chatbot using only a single layer of processing, using the text (character sequences) directly as the features for a language model. A chatbot that only does string matching and search is capable of participating in a reasonably convincing conversation if given enough example statements and responses.\n\nFor example, the open source project ChatterBot simplifies this pipeline by merely computing the string \"edit distance\" (Levenshtein distance) between an input statement and the statements recorded in its database. If its database of statement-response pairs contains a matching statement, the corresponding reply (from a previously \"learned\" human or machine dialog) can be reused as the reply to the latest user statement. For this pipeline, all that is required is step 3 (Generate) of our chatbot pipeline. And within this stage, only a brute-force search algorithm is required to find the best response. With this simple technique (no tokenization or feature generation required), ChatterBot can maintain a convincing conversion as the dialog engine for Salvius, a mechanical robot built from salvaged parts by Gunther Cox.\n[\n65\n]\nWill is an open source Python chatbot framework by Steven Skoczen with a completely different approach.\n[\n66\n]\nWill can only be trained to respond to statements by programming it with regular expressions. This is the labor-intensive and data-light approach to NLP. This grammar-based approach is especially effective for question-answering systems and task-execution assistant bots, like Lex, Siri, and Google Now. These kinds of systems overcome the \"brittleness\" of regular expressions by employing \"fuzzy regular expressions.\"footnote:[The Python regex package is backward compatible with re and adds fuzziness among other features. The regex will replace the re package in future Python versions\n(\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n).\nSimilarly TRE agrep, or \"approximate grep,\" (\nhttps://github.com/laurikari/tre\n)\nis an alternative to the UNIX command-line application grep.] and other techniques for finding approximate grammar matches. Fuzzy regular expressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible grammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring social media. If you need it to respond in real-time, without continuous monitoring by humans, you will need to think about ways to prevent it from saying things that harm your business, your reputation, or your users. You’ll need to do more than simply connect your users directly to the LLM.",
        "### Definitions\n\nVarious definitions of NLP highlight its interdisciplinary nature and goals:\n\n*   **\"Natural language processing is the set of methods for making human language accessible to computers\"** - *Jacob Eisenstein*. This definition focuses on enabling computers to process and understand human language.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is the field at the intersection of computer science and linguistics\"** - *Christopher Manning*. This definition underscores the confluence of computer science and linguistics in the study and development of NLP.\n*   **\"Make computers to understand natural language to do certain tasks humans can do such as translation, summarization, questions answering\"** - *Behrooz Mansouri*. This outlines the objective of NLP: to replicate human language-based tasks using computers, including translation, summarization, and question answering.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is an area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with processing natural languages such as English or Mandarin. This processing generally involves translating natural language into data that a computer can use to learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding.\"** - *(Natural Language Processing in Action)*. This comprehensive definition explains the process of converting natural language into a machine-understandable format, enabling computers to learn and generate human-like text.",
        "1.11 Natural language IQ\nLike human brainpower, the power of an NLP pipeline cannot be easily\ngauged with a single IQ score without considering multiple \"smarts\"\ndimensions. A common way to measure the capability of a robotic system is\nalong the dimensions of behavior complexity and the degree of human\nsupervision required. But for a natural language processing pipeline, the goal\nis to build systems that fully automate the processing of natural language,\neliminating all human supervision (once the model is trained and deployed).\nSo a better pair of IQ dimensions should capture the breadth and depth of the\ncomplexity of the natural language pipeline.\nA consumer product chatbot or virtual assistant like Alexa or Allo is usually\ndesigned to have extremely broad knowledge and capabilities. However, the\nlogic used to respond to requests tends to be shallow, often consisting of a set\nof trigger phrases that all produce the same response with a single if-then\ndecision branch. Alexa (and the underlying Lex engine) behave like a single\nlayer, flat tree of (if, elif, elif, …) statements.\n[\n68\n]\n Google Dialogflow (which\nwas developed independently of Google’s Allo and Google Assistant) has\nsimilar capabilities to Amazon Lex, Contact Flow, and Lambda, but without\nthe drag-and-drop user interface for designing your dialog tree.\nOn the other hand, the Google Translate pipeline (or any similar machine\ntranslation system) relies on a deep tree of feature extractors, decision trees,\nand knowledge graphs connecting bits of knowledge about the world.\nSometimes these feature extractors, decision trees, and knowledge graphs are\nexplicitly programmed into the system, as in Figure 1.5. Another approach\nrapidly overtaking this \"hand-coded\" pipeline is the deep learning data-driven\napproach. Feature extractors for deep neural networks are learned rather than\nhard-coded, but they often require much more training data to achieve the\nsame performance as intentionally designed algorithms.\nYou will use both approaches (neural networks and hand-coded algorithms)\nas you incrementally build an NLP pipeline for a chatbot capable of\nconversing within a focused knowledge domain. This will give you the skills\nyou need to accomplish the natural language processing tasks within your\nindustry or business domain. Along the way you will probably get ideas\nabout how to expand the breadth of things this NLP pipeline can do. Figure\n1.6 puts the chatbot in its place among the natural language processing\nsystems that are already out there. Imagine the chatbots you have interacted\nwith. Where do you think they might fit in a plot like this? Have you\nattempted to gauge their intelligence by probing them with difficult questions\nor something like an IQ test? Try asking a chatbot something ambiguous that\nrequires common sense logic and the ability to ask clarifying questions, such\nas \"What’s larger, the sun or a nickel?\"\n[\n69\n]\n you will get a chance to do exactly\nthat in later chapters, to help you decide how your chatbot stacks up against\nsome of the others in this diagram.\nFigure 1.9 2D IQ of some natural language processing systems\nAs you progress through this book, you will be building the elements of a\nchatbot. Chatbots require all the tools of NLP to work well:\nFeature extraction (usually to produce a vector space model)\nInformation extraction to be able to answer factual questions\nSemantic search to learn from previously recorded natural language text\nor dialog\nNatural language generation to compose new, meaningful statements\nMachine learning gives us a way to trick machines into behaving as if we had\nspent a lifetime programming them with hundreds of complex regular\nexpressions or algorithms. We can teach a machine to respond to patterns\nsimilar to the patterns defined in regular expressions by merely providing it\nexamples of user statements and the responses we want the chatbot to mimic.\nAnd the \"models\" of language, the FSMs, produced by machine learning, are\nmuch better. They are less picky about mispelings and typoz.\nAnd machine learning NLP pipelines are easier to \"program.\" We do not\nhave to anticipate every possible use of symbols in our language. We just\nhave to feed the training pipeline with examples of the phrases that match and\nwith example phrases that do not match. As long as we label the example\nphrases during training so that the chatbot knows which is which, it will learn\nto discriminate between them. And there are even machine learning\napproaches that require little if any \"labeled\" data.\nWe have given you some exciting reasons to learn about natural language\nprocessing. You want to help save the world, do you not? And we have\nattempted to pique your interest with some practical NLP applications that\nare revolutionizing the way we communicate, learn, do business, and even\nthink. It will not be long before you are able to build a system that\napproaches human-like conversational behavior. And you should be able to\nsee in upcoming chapters how to train a chatbot or NLP pipeline with any\ndomain knowledge that interests you — from finance and sports to\npsychology and literature. If you can find a corpus of writing about it, then\nyou can train a machine to understand it.\nThis book is about using machine learning to build smart text-reading\nmachines without you having to anticipate all the ways people can say things.\nEach chapter incrementally improves on the basic NLP pipeline for the\nchatbot introduced in this chapter.

        "### Importance of NLP\n\nThe significance of NLP is further emphasized by quotes from prominent figures:\n\n*   **\"Natural language is the most important part of Artificial Intelligence\"** - *John Searle, Philosopher*. This statement emphasizes the central role of natural language understanding in achieving true artificial intelligence.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, allowing computers to read and understand human language, as well as to produce and recognize speech\"** - *Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO*. This quote highlights NLP as a fundamental technology enabling computers to interact with human language in various forms.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is one of the most important fields in artificial intelligence and also one of the most difficult\"** - *Dan Jurafsky, Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at Stanford University*. This acknowledges both the importance and the challenges associated with NLP research and development.",
        "different approaches; we show you techniques for both.\n\nIn addition, deep learning and data-driven programming (machine learning, or probabilistic language modeling) have rapidly diversified the possible applications for NLP and chatbots. This data-driven approach allows ever greater sophistication for an NLP pipeline by providing it with greater and greater amounts of data in the domain you want to apply it to. And when a new machine learning approach is discovered that makes even better use of this data, with more efficient model generalization or regularization, then large jumps in capability are possible.\n\nThe NLP pipeline for a chatbot shown in Figure 1.4 contains all the building blocks for most of the NLP applications that we described at the start of this chapter. As in Taming Text, we break out our pipeline into four main subsystems or stages. In addition, we have explicitly called out a database to record data required for each of these stages and persist their configuration and training sets over time. This can enable batch or online retraining of each of the stages as the chatbot interacts with the world. We have also shown a \"feedback loop\" on our generated text responses so that our responses can be processed using the same algorithms used to process the user statements. The response \"scores\" or features can then be combined in an objective function to evaluate and select the best possible response, depending on the chatbot’s plan or goals for the dialog. This book is focused on configuring this NLP pipeline for a chatbot, but you may also be able to see the analogy to the NLP problem of text retrieval or \"search,\" perhaps the most common NLP application. And our chatbot pipeline is certainly appropriate for the question-answering application that was the focus of Taming Text.\n\nThe application of this pipeline to financial forecasting or business analytics may not be so obvious. But imagine the features generated by the analysis portion of your pipeline. These features of your analysis or feature generation can be optimized for your particular finance or business prediction. That way they can help you incorporate natural language data into a machine learning pipeline for forecasting. Despite focusing on building a chatbot, this book gives you the tools you need for a broad range of NLP applications, from search to financial forecasting.\n\nOne processing element in Figure 1.4 that is not typically employed in search, forecasting, or question-answering systems is natural language generation. For chatbots, this is their central feature. Nonetheless, the text generation step is often incorporated into a search engine NLP application and can give such an engine a large competitive advantage. The ability to consolidate or summarize search results is a winning feature for many popular search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google). And you can imagine how valuable it is for a financial forecasting engine to be able to generate statements, tweets, or entire articles based on the business-actionable events it detects in natural language streams from social media networks and news feeds.\n\nThe next section shows how the layers of such a system can be combined to create greater sophistication and capability at each stage of the NLP pipeline.\n\n### 1.10 Processing in depth\nThe stages of a natural language processing pipeline can be thought of as layers, like the layers in a feed-forward neural network. Deep learning is all about creating more complex models and behavior by adding additional processing layers to the conventional two-layer machine learning model architecture of feature extraction followed by modeling. In Chapter 5 we explain how neural networks help spread the learning across layers by backpropagating model errors from the output layers back to the input layers. But here we talk about the top layers and what can be done by training each layer independently of the other layers.\n\nFigure 1.8 Example layers for an NLP pipeline\nThe top four layers in Figure 1.8 correspond to the first two stages in the chatbot pipeline (feature extraction and feature analysis) in the previous section. For example, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging), is one way to generate features within the Analyze stage of our chatbot pipeline. POS tags are generated automatically by the default SpaCY pipeline, which includes all the top four layers in this diagram. POS tagging is typically accomplished with a finite state transducer like the methods in the nltk.tag package.\n\nThe bottom two layers (Entity Relationships and a Knowledge Base) are used to populate a database containing information (knowledge) about a particular domain. And the information extracted from a particular statement or document using all six of these layers can then be used in combination with that database to make inferences. Inferences are logical extrapolations from a set of conditions detected in the environment, like the logic contained in the statement of a chatbot user. This kind of \"inference engine\" in the deeper layers of this diagram is considered the domain of artificial intelligence, where machines can make inferences about their world and use those inferences to make logical decisions. However, chatbots can make reasonable decisions without this knowledge database, using only the algorithms of the upper few layers. And these decisions can combine to produce surprisingly human-like behaviors.\n\nOver the next few chapters, we dive down through the top few layers of NLP. The top three layers are all that is required to perform meaningful sentiment analysis and semantic search and to build human-mimicking chatbots. In fact, it’s possible to build a useful and interesting chatbot using only a single layer of processing, using the text (character sequences) directly as the features for a language model. A chatbot that only does string matching and search is capable of participating in a reasonably convincing conversation if given enough example statements and responses.\n\nFor example, the open source project ChatterBot simplifies this pipeline by merely computing the string \"edit distance\" (Levenshtein distance) between an input statement and the statements recorded in its database. If its database of statement-response pairs contains a matching statement, the corresponding reply (from a previously \"learned\" human or machine dialog) can be reused as the reply to the latest user statement. For this pipeline, all that is required is step 3 (Generate) of our chatbot pipeline. And within this stage, only a brute-force search algorithm is required to find the best response. With this simple technique (no tokenization or feature generation required), ChatterBot can maintain a convincing conversion as the dialog engine for Salvius, a mechanical robot built from salvaged parts by Gunther Cox.\n[\n65\n]\nWill is an open source Python chatbot framework by Steven Skoczen with a completely different approach.\n[\n66\n]\nWill can only be trained to respond to statements by programming it with regular expressions. This is the labor-intensive and data-light approach to NLP. This grammar-based approach is especially effective for question-answering systems and task-execution assistant bots, like Lex, Siri, and Google Now. These kinds of systems overcome the \"brittleness\" of regular expressions by employing \"fuzzy regular expressions.\"footnote:[The Python regex package is backward compatible with re and adds fuzziness among other features. The regex will replace the re package in future Python versions\n(\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n).\nSimilarly TRE agrep, or \"approximate grep,\" (\nhttps://github.com/laurikari/tre\n)\nis an alternative to the UNIX command-line application grep.] and other techniques for finding approximate grammar matches. Fuzzy regular expressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible grammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring social media. If you need it to respond in real-time, without continuous monitoring by humans, you will need to think about ways to prevent it from saying things that harm your business, your reputation, or your users. You’ll need to do more than simply connect your users directly to the LLM.",
        "### Definitions\n\nVarious definitions of NLP highlight its interdisciplinary nature and goals:\n\n*   **\"Natural language processing is the set of methods for making human language accessible to computers\"** - *Jacob Eisenstein*. This definition focuses on enabling computers to process and understand human language.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is the field at the intersection of computer science and linguistics\"** - *Christopher Manning*. This definition underscores the confluence of computer science and linguistics in the study and development of NLP.\n*   **\"Make computers to understand natural language to do certain tasks humans can do such as translation, summarization, questions answering\"** - *Behrooz Mansouri*. This outlines the objective of NLP: to replicate human language-based tasks using computers, including translation, summarization, and question answering.\n*   **\"Natural language processing is an area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with processing natural languages such as English or Mandarin. This processing generally involves translating natural language into data that a computer can use to learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding.\"** - *(Natural Language Processing in Action)*. This comprehensive definition explains the process of converting natural language into a machine-understandable format, enabling computers to learn and generate human-like text.",
        "1.11 Natural language IQ\nLike human brainpower, the power of an NLP pipeline cannot be easily\ngauged with a single IQ score without considering multiple \"smarts\"\ndimensions. A common way to measure the capability of a robotic system is\nalong the dimensions of behavior complexity and the degree of human\nsupervision required. But for a natural language processing pipeline, the goal\nis to build systems that fully automate the processing of natural language,\neliminating all human supervision (once the model is trained and deployed).\nSo a better pair of IQ dimensions should capture the breadth and depth of the\ncomplexity of the natural language pipeline.\nA consumer product chatbot or virtual assistant like Alexa or Allo is usually\ndesigned to have extremely broad knowledge and capabilities. However, the\nlogic used to respond to requests tends to be shallow, often consisting of a set\nof trigger phrases that all produce the same response with a single if-then\ndecision branch. Alexa (and the underlying Lex engine) behave like a single\nlayer, flat tree of (if, elif, elif, …) statements.\n[\n68\n]\n Google Dialogflow (which\nwas developed independently of Google’s Allo and Google Assistant) has\nsimilar capabilities to Amazon Lex, Contact Flow, and Lambda, but without\nthe drag-and-drop user interface for designing your dialog tree.\nOn the other hand, the Google Translate pipeline (or any similar machine\ntranslation system) relies on a deep tree of feature extractors, decision trees,\nand knowledge graphs connecting bits of knowledge about the world.\nSometimes these feature extractors, decision trees, and knowledge graphs are\nexplicitly programmed into the system, as in Figure 1.5. Another approach\nrapidly overtaking this \"hand-coded\" pipeline is the deep learning data-driven\napproach. Feature extractors for deep neural networks are learned rather than\nhard-coded, but they often require much more training data to achieve the\nsame performance as intentionally designed algorithms.\nYou will use both approaches (neural networks and hand-coded algorithms)\nas you incrementally build an NLP pipeline for a chatbot capable of\nconversing within a focused knowledge domain. This will give you the skills\nyou need to accomplish the natural language processing tasks within your\nindustry or business domain. Along the way you will probably get ideas\nabout how to expand the breadth of things this NLP pipeline can do. Figure\n1.6 puts the chatbot in its place among the natural language processing\nsystems that are already out there. Imagine the chatbots you have interacted\nwith. Where do you think they might fit in a plot like this? Have you\nattempted to gauge their intelligence by probing them with difficult questions\nor something like an IQ test? Try asking a chatbot something ambiguous that\nrequires common sense logic and the ability to ask clarifying questions, such\nas \"What’s larger, the sun or a nickel?\"\n[\n69\n]\n you will get a chance to do exactly\nthat in later chapters, to help you decide how your chatbot stacks up against\nsome of the others in this diagram.\nFigure 1.9 2D IQ of some natural language processing systems\nAs you progress through this book, you will be building the elements of a\nchatbot. Chatbots require all the tools of NLP to work well:\nFeature extraction (usually to produce a vector space model)\nInformation extraction to be able to answer factual questions\nSemantic search to learn from previously recorded natural language text\nor dialog\nNatural language generation to compose new, meaningful statements\nMachine learning gives us a way to trick machines into behaving as if we had\nspent a lifetime programming them with hundreds of complex regular\nexpressions or algorithms. We can teach a machine to respond to patterns\nsimilar to the patterns defined in regular expressions by merely providing it\nexamples of user statements and the responses we want the chatbot to mimic.\nAnd the \"models\" of language, the FSMs, produced by machine learning, are\nmuch better. They are less picky about mispelings and typoz.\nAnd machine learning NLP pipelines are easier to \"program.\" We do not\nhave to anticipate every possible use of symbols in our language. We just\nhave to feed the training pipeline with examples of the phrases that match and\nwith example phrases that do not match. As long as we label the example\nphrases during training so that the chatbot knows which is which, it will learn\nto discriminate between them. And there are even machine learning\napproaches that require little if any \"labeled\" data.\nWe have given you some exciting reasons to learn about natural language\nprocessing. You want to help save the world, do you not? And we have\nattempted to pique your interest with some practical NLP applications that\nare revolutionizing the way we communicate, learn, do business, and even\nthink. It will not be long before you are able to build a system that\napproaches human-like conversational behavior. And you should be able to\nsee in upcoming chapters how to train a chatbot or NLP pipeline with any\ndomain knowledge that interests you — from finance and sports to\npsychology and literature. If you can find a corpus of writing about it, then\nyou can train a machine to understand it.\nThis book is about using machine learning to build smart text-reading\nmachines without you having to anticipate all the ways people can say things.\nEach chapter incrementally improves on the basic NLP pipeline for the\nchatbot introduced in this chapter. As you learn the tools of natural language\nprocessing, you will be building an NLP pipeline that can not only carry on a\nconversation but help you accomplish your goals in business and in life.",

This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",

It allows developers to create complex workflows that include multiple checks and filters.\n*   **OpenAI Moderation:** A prebuilt API from OpenAI to detect unsafe content. It provides a simple and effective way to identify and block harmful language.\n\n`",
        "`\n\n**Additional Contextual Insights:**\n\n**Hardening NLP Software:** It is crucial to harden your NLP software to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text. Creating \"bug bounties\" incentivizes users to find gaps in your guardrails, turning adversarial curiosity into productive feedback. Open source frameworks, like Guardrails-ai, offer configurable rule templates, acting as real-time unit tests for your system.\n\n**Machine Learning Classifiers:** Traditional machine learning classifiers are effective in detecting malicious intent or inappropriate content in LLM outputs. To prevent the provision of regulated advice (e.g., legal or medical), custom ML models generalize from examples, providing high reliability. These models also protect against prompt injection attacks.\n\n**Advanced Filtering Techniques:** For precise or complex rules, consider open source tools that use languages similar to regular expressions to specify general filter rules. Tools such as SpaCy’s Matcher, ReLM patterns, Eleuther AI’s LM evaluation harness, and Guardrails-AI \"rail\" language aid in specifying these rules. However, guardrails-ai may not fully prevent LLMs from going off the rails but can be helpful in other aspects of rule creation and implementation.\n\n**Guardrails-AI Package Details:** Ensure the correct installation of the `guardrails-ai` package (with the \"-ai\" suffix). This package uses \"RAIL,\" a domain-specific form of XML, to specify guardrail rules for building retrieval-augmented LLMs that don't fake answers, ensuring a fallback to \"I don’t know\" responses when appropriate.\n\n**Alternatives to RAIL:** If XML-based templating is cumbersome, standard Python templating systems like f-strings or jinja2 templates offer better alternatives for building prompt strings. The LangChain package also provides example LLM prompt templates.\n\n**Rule-Based Systems:** For production applications, rule-based systems like SpaCy Matcher patterns are preferable over guardrails-ai or LangChain because they offer fuzzy rules to detect misspellings or transliterations and incorporate NLU semantic matching.\n\n**SpaCy Matcher for Taboo Words:** Configure SpaCy Matcher to avoid taboo words or names, substituting them with synonyms or generic alternatives. This approach can also protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Implementing a bad word detector is a flexible method for any undesirable content.\n\n**Correcting Bad Words with SpaCy Matcher:** To correct bad words with acceptable substitutes, add a separate named matcher for each word in your list, which enables accurate correction even with typos.\n\n**Semantic Matching:** Augment the SpaCy matcher with semantic matching using word embeddings to filter semantically similar words, creating a robust pipeline that improves over time with added data and models.\n\n**Red Teaming:** Employ \"red teaming\" to efficiently build a dataset of edge cases and improve NLP pipeline reliability. Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance. However, the effectiveness of scaling is questioned, with some research indicating that increased dataset size doesn't necessarily create more intelligent behavior but rather more confident and intelligent-sounding text.\n\n**Llama 2 and Open Source Models:** Open source models like BLOOMZ, StableLM, InstructGPT, and Llama2 are optimized for more modest hardware, enabling efficient generalization and more accurate behavior.\n\n**Meta Models:** Building higher-level meta models that utilize LLMs and other NLP pipelines can break down prompts into actionable steps, generating API queries to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n\n**LLM Temperature Parameter:** The temperature parameter in LLMs controls the randomness of generated text. Lower temperatures result in more predictable and consistent outputs, while higher temperatures increase creativity and variability. Understanding and adjusting this parameter is crucial for controlling LLM behavior.\n\n**Teaching Math with LLMs:** While LLMs can successfully improvise onboarding conversations for math tutors, they struggle with math reasoning. Grounding models with specific questions and curating their responses is crucial to ensure reliability.",
        "`\n\n**Best Practices for Implementing Guardrails:**\n\n*   **Combine Multiple Techniques:** For robust safeguards, it is recommended to combine multiple techniques. For example, using rule-based filtering, external validation, and fine-tuning together.\n\n*   **Example:** Combining rule-based filtering to block offensive keywords, external validation to check for factual accuracy, and fine-tuning to align the model with ethical guidelines provides a comprehensive safeguard.\n\n`",

By making the source code and training data accessible to the public, researchers and developers can gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of these models, which is crucial for effective prompt engineering. \n\nOne key advantage of open-source LLMs is the ability to inspect and modify their training processes. This transparency enables developers to identify biases, errors, or limitations within the model and address them through prompt engineering. For example, if an open-source LLM exhibits a bias towards a specific demographic group, prompt engineering techniques can be used to mitigate this bias by carefully crafting prompts that emphasize fairness, inclusivity, and equal representation. \n\nMoreover, open-source LLMs encourage collaboration and innovation within the research community. By making the models accessible, developers can experiment with different prompt engineering techniques, share their findings, and build upon each other's work. This collaborative approach can accelerate the development of more advanced prompt engineering methods, benefiting a wide range of applications. \n\nAdditionally, open-source LLMs can be customized and tailored to specific use cases. With access to the source code, developers can fine-tune the models to better suit their specific applications, and prompt engineering techniques can be used to further specialize the model's behavior for particular tasks. This level of customization can improve the accuracy and relevance of the LLM's responses, making them more applicable in diverse domains. \n\nThe potential advantages of open-sourcing LLMs also extend to ethical considerations. With access to the model's inner workings, it becomes easier to identify and address ethical concerns, such as privacy, fairness, and transparency.

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",
        "`\n\n**Goal of the Project (Detailed):**\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a chatbot proficient in answering questions related to the NLP and LLM course content for the 2024/2025 academic year. The chatbot's knowledge domain extends beyond the specific topics covered in class to include general course information. Examples include identifying course teachers, recommending textbooks, and providing other relevant details regarding the course structure and administration.\n\nA critical requirement is that the chatbot must **exclusively** address questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM course. It must accurately identify and reject out-of-context queries, responding appropriately that it is not authorized to provide information outside the designated scope. This capability ensures that the chatbot remains a focused and reliable resource for course-related inquiries.\n\nProject deliverables include:\n\n*   **Chatbot Code:** The complete source code of the implemented chatbot.\n*   **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the chatbot solution. The report should offer a detailed explanation of the chosen architecture, algorithms, and any specific techniques used to achieve the project goals.\n\n`",

        "**Contextual Enrichment: The Role of Chatbot Frameworks and LLMs**\n\nThe exercise of creating a pizzeria chatbot highlights practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of chatbot frameworks. Building functional and engaging chatbots requires careful consideration of several factors, including the user's intent, the bot's responses, and the overall conversational flow.\n\nChatbot frameworks are designed to abstract away many of the complexities involved in creating a dialog engine, allowing developers to focus on designing the bot's behavior in a domain-specific language.\n\nAs the included context emphasizes, teachers inspire students using feedback on how well the student understands the material. They also think up new ideas as students pose interesting new questions. Students' needs are diverse and dynamic. Due to this fact, hybrid chatbots integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a better method for creating production chatbots in all domains. LLMs are proficient and convincing in their ability to converse with users on virtually any topic. However, the key is to control this power intelligently to prevent misleading or harmful interactions."

        "## T5\n\n### T5\nT5, which stands for Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, is a language model developed by Google Research. It leverages an encoder-decoder transformer architecture. A key feature of T5 is its \"text-to-text\" approach, where every NLP task is framed as converting a text input to a text output. This simplifies the model's design and allows it to be applied to a wide variety of tasks with minimal modifications.\n\nT5 is available in various sizes, allowing users to select a model that best fits their computational resource constraints. The different sizes offer trade-offs between model performance and resource usage. Larger models generally achieve higher accuracy but require more memory and processing power.\n\nThe following table details the configurations of the different T5 versions:\n\n| Version   | Encoder Blocks | Attention Heads | Decoder Blocks | Embedding Dimensionality |\n| --------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |\n| T5-Small  | 6              | 8               | 6              | 512                      |\n| T5-Base   | 12             | 12              | 12             | 768                      |\n| T5-Large  | 24             | 16              | 24             | 1024                     |\n| T5-XL     | 24             | 32              | 24             | 2048                     |\n| T5-XXL    | 24             | 64              | 24             | 4096                     |\n\n*   **Encoder Blocks:** The number of transformer blocks in the encoder.

    "final_response": "```html\n<div>\n  To adapt the sentiment analysis tuning example from the TRL documentation for a different text classification task, you'll need to modify the dataset, reward model, and fine-tuning process. Here's a breakdown of the necessary changes:\n\n  <h3>1. Dataset Modification:</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Task-Specific Data:</b> Replace the sentiment analysis dataset with a dataset relevant to your new text classification task. For instance, if you're classifying news articles by topic (e.g., sports, politics, technology), your dataset should consist of news articles labeled with their corresponding topics.</li>\n    <li><b>Data Format:</b> Ensure your dataset is formatted in a way that's compatible with the TRL library. Typically, this involves having a text field containing the input text and a label field indicating the correct class. The <code>dataset_text_field</code> in the <code>SFTTrainer</code> should point to the text field in your dataset.</li>\n    <li><b>Dataset Diversity:</b> Ensure that the dataset includes examples from various domains and covers different aspects of the text classification task. This diversity is essential to ensure that the model can generalize beyond the specific examples it has seen during fine-tuning and adapt to a wide range of inputs.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>2. Reward Model Modification:</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Reward Signal Definition:</b> The reward model needs to be adapted to reflect the goals of your new text classification task. In the sentiment analysis example, the reward model likely outputs a score based on the sentiment of the generated text. For a different task, the reward model should evaluate the quality of the classification.</li>\n    <li><b>Training Data for Reward Model:</b> Train the reward model using the new dataset. The reward model should learn to assign higher rewards to outputs that correctly classify the input text and lower rewards to incorrect classifications.</li>\n    <li><b>Reward Function:</b> The reward function should reflect the accuracy of the classification. For example, you could use a binary reward (1 for correct classification, 0 for incorrect) or a more nuanced reward based on the confidence of the classification.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>3. Fine-Tuning Process Modification:</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>SFT Phase:</b> In the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase, use the new dataset to fine-tune the base language model. The goal is to train the model to generate outputs that are relevant to the classification task.</li>\n    <li><b>PPO Phase:</b> During the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) phase, use the reward model to guide the fine-tuning process. The PPO algorithm will adjust the language model's parameters to maximize the rewards received from the reward model.</li>\n    <li><b>Query Prompts:</b> Adapt the query prompts used in the PPO training loop to be relevant to your text classification task. These prompts should be designed to elicit responses that can be evaluated by the reward model.</li>\n    <li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Monitor the performance of the fine-tuned model using appropriate evaluation metrics for your text classification task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  By carefully modifying the dataset, reward model, and fine-tuning process, you can successfully adapt the sentiment analysis tuning example to a different text classification task using the TRL library.\n</div>\n```",

        "## Additional Context\n\nHere is further relevant context to the topic covered.\n\nPopular sampling techniques that are often used in practice are top-k sampling and nucleus sampling. We won’t discuss all of them here - you can read more about them in HuggingFace’s excellent guide.\n[\n26\n]\nLet’s try to generate text using nucleus sampling method. In this method, instead of choosing among the K most likely words, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is smaller than p. So if there are only a few candidates with large probabilities, the \"nucleus\" would be smaller, than in the case of larger group of candidates with smaller probabilities. Note that because sampling is probabilistic, the generated text will be different for you - this is not something that can be controlled with a random seed.\n\nListing 10.7 Generating text using nucleus sampling method\n```python\n>>> nucleus_sampling_args = {\n...    'do_sample': True,\n...    'max_length': 50,\n...    'top_p': 0.92\n... }\n>>> print(generate(prompt='NLP is a', **nucleus_sampling_args))\n```\nNLP is a multi-level network protocol, which is one of the most well-documented protocols for managing data transfer protocols. This is useful if one can perform network transfers using one data transfer protocol and another protocol or protocol in the same chain.\nOK. This is better, but still not quite what you were looking for. Your output still uses the same words too much (just count how many times \"protocol\" was mentioned!) But more importantly, though NLP indeed can stand for Network Layer Protocol, it’s not what you were looking for. To get generated text that is domain-specific, you need to fine-tune our model - that means, to train it on a dataset that is specific to our task.\n\n### 10.1.7 Fine-tuning your generative model\nIn your case, this dataset would be this very book, parsed into a database of lines. Let’s load it from nlpia2 repository. In this case, we only need the book’s text, so we’ll ignore code, headers, and all other things that will not be helpful for our generative model.\nLet’s also initialize a new version of our GPT-2 model for finetuning. We can reuse the tokenizer for GPT-2 we initialized before.\n\nListing 10.8 Loading the NLPiA2 lines as training data for GPT-2\n```python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> DATASET_URL = ('https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/'\n...     '-/raw/main/src/nlpia2/data/nlpia_lines.csv')\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_URL)\n>>> df = df[df['is_text']]\n>>> lines = df.line_text.copy()\n```\n\nThis will read all the sentences of natural language text in the manuscript for this book. Each line or sentence will be a different \"document\" in your NLP pipeline, so your model will learn how to generate sentences rather than longer passages. You want to wrap your list of sentences with a PyTorch Dataset class so that your text will be structured in the way that our training pipeline expects.\n\nListing 10.9 Creating a PyTorch Dataset for training\n```python\n>>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n>>> from torch.utils.data import random_split\n>>> class NLPiADataset(Dataset):\n>>>     def __init__(self, txt_list, tokenizer, max_length=768):\n>>>         self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n>>>         self.input_ids = []\n>>>         self.attn_masks = []\n>>>         for txt in txt_list:\n>>>             encodings_dict = tokenizer(txt, truncation=True,\n...                 max_length=max_length, padding=\"max_length\")\n>>>             self.input_ids.append(\n...                 torch.tensor(encodings_dict['input_ids']))\n>>>     def __len__(self):\n>>>         return len(self.input_ids)\n>>>     def __getitem__(self, idx):\n>>>         return self.input_ids[idx]\n```\nNow, we want to set aside some samples for evaluating our loss mid-training. Usually, we would need to wrap them in the DataLoader wrapper, but luckily, the Transformers package simplifies things for us.\n\nListing 10.10 Creating training and evaluation sets for fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> dataset = NLPiADataset(lines, tokenizer, max_length=768)\n>>> train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))\n>>> eval_size = len(dataset) - train_size\n>>> train_dataset, eval_dataset = random_split(\n...     dataset, [train_size, eval_size])\n```\n\nFinally, you need one more Transformers library object - DataCollator. It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```",
        "**Using NLTK**\n\nThe Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular Python library for NLP.\n\n*   Installation: `pip install nltk`\n*   Features: It includes refined tokenizers and stop-word lists for many languages.\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download('punkt') # download the Punkt tokenizer models\ntext = \"Good muffins cost $3.88\\nin New York. Please buy me two of them.\\n\\nThanks.\"\n\nprint(nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(text)) # word tokenization\nprint(nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize(text)) # sentence tokenization\n```\n\nThe `nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize()` function splits the text into words, and `nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize()` splits the text into sentences. The `punkt` model must be downloaded to run the example.\n\n```\n['Good', 'muffins', 'cost', '$', '3.88', 'in', 'New', 'York', '.', 'Please', 'buy', 'me', 'two', 'of', 'them', '.', 'Thanks', '.']\n['Good muffins cost $3.88\\nin New York.', 'Please buy me two of them.', 'Thanks.']\n```"

The value in each dimension represents the weight of that term in the document.\n\n### NLTK Corpora\n\nThe Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python library that provides various resources for NLP tasks, including access to several text corpora.\n\n*   NLTK corpora are collections of text documents used for training and testing NLP algorithms.\n*   NLTK provides convenient tools for accessing corpus data.\n*   [https://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html](https://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html)\n\n### Reuters 21578 corpus\n\nThe Reuters-21578 corpus is a widely used dataset for NLP, particularly for text classification.\n\n*   It contains thousands of news articles published by Reuters in 1987.\n*   The news articles are categorized into 90 different topics.\n*   It's a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating text classification algorithms.",
        "### Using Reuters 21578\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download('reuters') # Download the reuters corpus\nids = nltk.corpus.reuters.fileids() # Ids of the documents\nsample = nltk.corpus.reuters.raw(ids[0]) # First document\n\nprint(len(ids), \"samples.\\n\") # Number of documents\nprint(sample)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Import NLTK:** Imports the NLTK library.\n\n2.  **Download Corpus:** Downloads the Reuters corpus.

        "## Additional Context\n\nHere is further relevant context to the topic covered.\n\nPopular sampling techniques that are often used in practice are top-k sampling and nucleus sampling. We won’t discuss all of them here - you can read more about them in HuggingFace’s excellent guide.\n[\n26\n]\nLet’s try to generate text using nucleus sampling method. In this method, instead of choosing among the K most likely words, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is smaller than p. So if there are only a few candidates with large probabilities, the \"nucleus\" would be smaller, than in the case of larger group of candidates with smaller probabilities. Note that because sampling is probabilistic, the generated text will be different for you - this is not something that can be controlled with a random seed.\n\nListing 10.7 Generating text using nucleus sampling method\n```python\n>>> nucleus_sampling_args = {\n...    'do_sample': True,\n...    'max_length': 50,\n...    'top_p': 0.92\n... }\n>>> print(generate(prompt='NLP is a', **nucleus_sampling_args))\n```\nNLP is a multi-level network protocol, which is one of the most well-documented protocols for managing data transfer protocols. This is useful if one can perform network transfers using one data transfer protocol and another protocol or protocol in the same chain.\nOK. This is better, but still not quite what you were looking for. Your output still uses the same words too much (just count how many times \"protocol\" was mentioned!) But more importantly, though NLP indeed can stand for Network Layer Protocol, it’s not what you were looking for. To get generated text that is domain-specific, you need to fine-tune our model - that means, to train it on a dataset that is specific to our task.\n\n### 10.1.7 Fine-tuning your generative model\nIn your case, this dataset would be this very book, parsed into a database of lines. Let’s load it from nlpia2 repository. In this case, we only need the book’s text, so we’ll ignore code, headers, and all other things that will not be helpful for our generative model.\nLet’s also initialize a new version of our GPT-2 model for finetuning. We can reuse the tokenizer for GPT-2 we initialized before.\n\nListing 10.8 Loading the NLPiA2 lines as training data for GPT-2\n```python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> DATASET_URL = ('https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/'\n...     '-/raw/main/src/nlpia2/data/nlpia_lines.csv')\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_URL)\n>>> df = df[df['is_text']]\n>>> lines = df.line_text.copy()\n```\n\nThis will read all the sentences of natural language text in the manuscript for this book. Each line or sentence will be a different \"document\" in your NLP pipeline, so your model will learn how to generate sentences rather than longer passages. You want to wrap your list of sentences with a PyTorch Dataset class so that your text will be structured in the way that our training pipeline expects.\n\nListing 10.9 Creating a PyTorch Dataset for training\n```python\n>>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n>>> from torch.utils.data import random_split\n>>> class NLPiADataset(Dataset):\n>>>     def __init__(self, txt_list, tokenizer, max_length=768):\n>>>         self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n>>>         self.input_ids = []\n>>>         self.attn_masks = []\n>>>         for txt in txt_list:\n>>>             encodings_dict = tokenizer(txt, truncation=True,\n...                 max_length=max_length, padding=\"max_length\")\n>>>             self.input_ids.append(\n...                 torch.tensor(encodings_dict['input_ids']))\n>>>     def __len__(self):\n>>>         return len(self.input_ids)\n>>>     def __getitem__(self, idx):\n>>>         return self.input_ids[idx]\n```\nNow, we want to set aside some samples for evaluating our loss mid-training. Usually, we would need to wrap them in the DataLoader wrapper, but luckily, the Transformers package simplifies things for us.\n\nListing 10.10 Creating training and evaluation sets for fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> dataset = NLPiADataset(lines, tokenizer, max_length=768)\n>>> train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))\n>>> eval_size = len(dataset) - train_size\n>>> train_dataset, eval_dataset = random_split(\n...     dataset, [train_size, eval_size])\n```\n\nFinally, you need one more Transformers library object - DataCollator. It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```",
        "**Using NLTK**\n\nThe Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular Python library for NLP.\n\n*   Installation: `pip install nltk`\n*   Features: It includes refined tokenizers and stop-word lists for many languages.\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download('punkt') # download the Punkt tokenizer models\ntext = \"Good muffins cost $3.88\\nin New York. Please buy me two of them.\\n\\nThanks.\"\n\nprint(nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(text)) # word tokenization\nprint(nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize(text)) # sentence tokenization\n```\n\nThe `nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize()` function splits the text into words, and `nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize()` splits the text into sentences. The `punkt` model must be downloaded to run the example.\n\n```\n['Good', 'muffins', 'cost', '$', '3.88', 'in', 'New', 'York', '.', 'Please', 'buy', 'me', 'two', 'of', 'them', '.', 'Thanks', '.']\n['Good muffins cost $3.88\\nin New York.', 'Please buy me two of them.', 'Thanks.']\n```"

This approach enables BERT to handle both common words and rare or misspelled words effectively by decomposing them into smaller, manageable parts.\n*   **Vocabulary Building**: The WordPiece tokenizer constructs a vocabulary consisting of common words and subword units. For instance, the word \"playing\" might be tokenized as \"play\" and \"##ing,\" where \"##\" indicates that it is a subword unit.\n*   **Unknown Words**: When encountering rare or out-of-vocabulary words, WordPiece breaks them down into familiar subwords. For example, \"unhappiness\" could be split into \"un,\" \"happy,\" and \"##ness.\" This ensures that BERT can process any input, even if it contains words not seen during training.\n\nThis section details the WordPiece tokenization method used by BERT, explaining its subword-based approach and how it handles unknown words.",

Unlike many commercial frameworks, that create a drag-and-drop\ninterface to create the dialog trees we discussed in the previous section,\nRASA took a radically different approach to organizing multi-step\nconversations.\nThe basic units of a conversation in RASA are a user intent and a bot action -\nwhich can be as simple as a pre-programmed utterance or a complex action\nprogrammed in Python that results in interaction with other systems - such as\nsaving or retrieving data from a database, or invoking a Web API. By\nchaining these building blocks into sequences - called Stories - RASA allows\nyou to pre-program dialog scenarios in a streamlined way. All this\ninformation is stored in YAML files (YAML stands for Yet Another Markup\nLanguage), each type of components in its own file.\nBut enough with the theoretical explanation - let’s get your hands dirty and\nbuild your first RASA chatbot. First, let’s decide what dialog we want to\nimplement - based on our conversation diagram for the math tutor bot, let’s\nimplement the following short dialog:\nUSER: Hello\nBOT: Well, hello there. Thanks for checking out Rori, a math tutor chatbot. Chatting with Rori helps students improve their math skills. And it's fun too!\nBOT: Are you a parent (or guardian) or are you a student?\nUSER: I'm a parent.\nBOT: For your child to use Rori, we need permission from the parent or guardian. Do you agree to give your child permission to chat with Rori on this Whatsapp number?\nUSER: I agree\nBOT: Thank you for giving permission for your child to chat with Rori.\nWhen your child is ready to start, please give them this phone and have them type \"ready\".\nTo create your bot, you will need to install \nrasa\n package (if you’re working\nin \nnlpia2\n environment, it is already installed when you install the project).\nThen, you can go to the directory you want to create the project in and run in\nyour command line:\n$ rasa init\nThe installation wizard will guide you through creating a new project and\neven offer you to train an initial model. Let it do that, and then you can even\nchat with a simple chatbot the wizard initialized for you.\nLet’s now dive into the structure of our project and understand how to build a\ndialog like you’ve just had. Here is the directory structure you should see in\nthe project’s folder:\n├───.rasa\n│   └───cache\n│       ├───...\n├───actions\n│   └───__pycache__\n├───data\n├───models\n└───tests\nThe directory we are most interested in is the \ndata\n directory. It contains the\nfiles that define the data that is used to train the chatbot’s NLU model. First,\nthere’s the \nnlu.yml\n file, which contains the intents and examples of user\nutterances that are used to train the intent recognition model. So let’s start\ncreating the intents that are used in our dialog. For every intent you want to\ndefine, you need to provide a name and a list of examples of utterances that\nbelong to this intent.\nFor our short dialog, we need to understand the user’s greeting, their role\n(parent or student), and their agreement to give permission to their child to\nuse the chatbot.\nversion\n: \n\"\n3.1\n\"\nnlu\n:\n- \nintent: greet\n  \nexamples\n: \n|\n - hey - hello - hi\n- \nintent: parent\n - I am a parent - Parent - I'm a mom to 12 year old\n- \nintent: agree\n...\nPretty straightforward, right? RASA will warn if you have too few examples\nfor a particular intent, and recommends at least 7-10 utterance examples per\nintent.\nThe next file you should look at is \ndomain.yml\naccount. When text message chatbots came onto the scene most continued to\nfollow this dark pattern of non-cooperative conversation, trying your patience\nand preventing you from creating cost for the business. The more advanced\nNLP skills you have learned in this book now give you the power to build\nchatbots that can simulate intelligent conversation and do useful work for you\nand your organization.\nThe chatbot boom is not over yet.

        "12.5.1 Building an intent-based chatbot with Rasa\nRasa is an open-source conversational framework that started back in 2016\nand today is used to create thousands of bots in various languages around the\nworld. Unlike many commercial frameworks, that create a drag-and-drop\ninterface to create the dialog trees we discussed in the previous section,\nRASA took a radically different approach to organizing multi-step\nconversations.\nThe basic units of a conversation in RASA are a user intent and a bot action -\nwhich can be as simple as a pre-programmed utterance or a complex action\nprogrammed in Python that results in interaction with other systems - such as\nsaving or retrieving data from a database, or invoking a Web API. By\nchaining these building blocks into sequences - called Stories - RASA allows\nyou to pre-program dialog scenarios in a streamlined way. All this\ninformation is stored in YAML files (YAML stands for Yet Another Markup\nLanguage), each type of components in its own file.\nBut enough with the theoretical explanation - let’s get your hands dirty and\nbuild your first RASA chatbot. First, let’s decide what dialog we want to\nimplement - based on our conversation diagram for the math tutor bot, let’s\nimplement the following short dialog:\nUSER: Hello\nBOT: Well, hello there. Thanks for checking out Rori, a math tutor chatbot. Chatting with Rori helps students improve their math skills. And it's fun too!\nBOT: Are you a parent (or guardian) or are you a student?\nUSER: I'm a parent.\nBOT: For your child to use Rori, we need permission from the parent or guardian. Do you agree to give your child permission to chat with Rori on this Whatsapp number?\nUSER: I agree\nBOT: Thank you for giving permission for your child to chat with Rori.\nWhen your child is ready to start, please give them this phone and have them type \"ready\".\nTo create your bot, you will need to install \nrasa\n package (if you’re working\nin \nnlpia2\n environment, it is already installed when you install the project).\nThen, you can go to the directory you want to create the project in and run in\nyour command line:\n$ rasa init\nThe installation wizard will guide you through creating a new project and\neven offer you to train an initial model.

        "## Loss Function and Optimization\nGPT models utilize specific loss functions, optimizers, and learning rate schedules during pre-training to achieve optimal performance.\n\n*   **Cross-Entropy Loss:** GPT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between the predicted token probabilities and the actual tokens. This loss function is well-suited to classification tasks (like predicting the next token) and provides the model with feedback on its predictions.\n*   **Adam Optimizer:** GPT uses the Adam optimizer, an adaptive gradient descent technique, which helps accelerate convergence by adjusting learning rates based on past gradients. Adam is efficient in handling large datasets and complex models.\n*   **Learning Rate Scheduling:** GPT applies a learning rate scheduling in which learning rates are gradually increased (warm-up) in the early stages and then decayed to prevent instability during training. This approach helps the model converge more effectively.\n*   **Large Batch Sizes:** Large batch sizes are used to stabilize training and make the model better at generalizing across diverse language patterns. Larger batches provide more accurate gradient estimates, leading to better generalization.",
        "**Contextual Enrichment: The Role of Chatbot Frameworks and LLMs**\n\nThe exercise of creating a pizzeria chatbot highlights practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of chatbot frameworks. Building functional and engaging chatbots requires careful consideration of several factors, including the user's intent, the bot's responses, and the overall conversational flow.\n\nChatbot frameworks are designed to abstract away many of the complexities involved in creating a dialog engine, allowing developers to focus on designing the bot's behavior in a domain-specific language.\n\nAs the included context emphasizes, teachers inspire students using feedback on how well the student understands the material. They also think up new ideas as students pose interesting new questions. Students' needs are diverse and dynamic. Due to this fact, hybrid chatbots integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a better method for creating production chatbots in all domains. LLMs are proficient and convincing in their ability to converse with users on virtually any topic. However, the key is to control this power intelligently to prevent misleading or harmful interactions.",

        "`\n\n**Additional Contextual Insights:**\n\n**Hardening NLP Software:** It is crucial to harden your NLP software to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text. Creating \"bug bounties\" incentivizes users to find gaps in your guardrails, turning adversarial curiosity into productive feedback. Open source frameworks, like Guardrails-ai, offer configurable rule templates, acting as real-time unit tests for your system.\n\n**Machine Learning Classifiers:** Traditional machine learning classifiers are effective in detecting malicious intent or inappropriate content in LLM outputs. To prevent the provision of regulated advice (e.g., legal or medical), custom ML models generalize from examples, providing high reliability. These models also protect against prompt injection attacks.\n\n**Advanced Filtering Techniques:** For precise or complex rules, consider open source tools that use languages similar to regular expressions to specify general filter rules. Tools such as SpaCy’s Matcher, ReLM patterns, Eleuther AI’s LM evaluation harness, and Guardrails-AI \"rail\" language aid in specifying these rules. However, guardrails-ai may not fully prevent LLMs from going off the rails but can be helpful in other aspects of rule creation and implementation.\n\n**Guardrails-AI Package Details:** Ensure the correct installation of the `guardrails-ai` package (with the \"-ai\" suffix). This package uses \"RAIL,\" a domain-specific form of XML, to specify guardrail rules for building retrieval-augmented LLMs that don't fake answers, ensuring a fallback to \"I don’t know\" responses when appropriate.\n\n**Alternatives to RAIL:** If XML-based templating is cumbersome, standard Python templating systems like f-strings or jinja2 templates offer better alternatives for building prompt strings. The LangChain package also provides example LLM prompt templates.\n\n**Rule-Based Systems:** For production applications, rule-based systems like SpaCy Matcher patterns are preferable over guardrails-ai or LangChain because they offer fuzzy rules to detect misspellings or transliterations and incorporate NLU semantic matching.\n\n**SpaCy Matcher for Taboo Words:** Configure SpaCy Matcher to avoid taboo words or names, substituting them with synonyms or generic alternatives. This approach can also protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Implementing a bad word detector is a flexible method for any undesirable content.\n\n**Correcting Bad Words with SpaCy Matcher:** To correct bad words with acceptable substitutes, add a separate named matcher for each word in your list, which enables accurate correction even with typos.\n\n**Semantic Matching:** Augment the SpaCy matcher with semantic matching using word embeddings to filter semantically similar words, creating a robust pipeline that improves over time with added data and models.\n\n**Red Teaming:** Employ \"red teaming\" to efficiently build a dataset of edge cases and improve NLP pipeline reliability. Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance. However, the effectiveness of scaling is questioned, with some research indicating that increased dataset size doesn't necessarily create more intelligent behavior but rather more confident and intelligent-sounding text.\n\n**Llama 2 and Open Source Models:** Open source models like BLOOMZ, StableLM, InstructGPT, and Llama2 are optimized for more modest hardware, enabling efficient generalization and more accurate behavior.\n\n**Meta Models:** Building higher-level meta models that utilize LLMs and other NLP pipelines can break down prompts into actionable steps, generating API queries to accomplish tasks efficiently.\n\n**LLM Temperature Parameter:** The temperature parameter in LLMs controls the randomness of generated text. Lower temperatures result in more predictable and consistent outputs, while higher temperatures increase creativity and variability. Understanding and adjusting this parameter is crucial for controlling LLM behavior.\n\n**Teaching Math with LLMs:** While LLMs can successfully improvise onboarding conversations for math tutors, they struggle with math reasoning. Grounding models with specific questions and curating their responses is crucial to ensure reliability.",

The ability to design different pre-training objectives allows researchers to tailor the model to specific downstream tasks or to explore different aspects of language understanding.\n*   Different NLP tasks seem to be highly transferable, producing effective representations that form a general model, which can serve as the backbone for many specialized models. This transferability is a key benefit of pre-training, allowing models to be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal task-specific training.\n*   With Self-Supervised Learning, the models seem to be able to learn from generating the language itself, rather than from any specific task. Self-supervised learning enables models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data, unlocking the potential to capture intricate patterns and relationships in language.\n*   Language Model can be used as a Knowledge Base, namely a generatively pre-trained model may have a decent zero-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks. The knowledge acquired during pre-training can be surprisingly effective, enabling the model to perform reasonably well on tasks without any explicit fine-tuning."

Full fine-tuning involves updating *all* the model's parameters, enabling the model to fully leverage its capacity and potentially achieve high accuracy.

        "**Text Segmentation**\n\nText segmentation is the process of dividing text into meaningful units. This is a crucial step in NLP, as it prepares the text for further analysis. The segmentation process can be performed at different levels:\n\n*   Paragraph Segmentation: Dividing a document into individual paragraphs, often based on whitespace or specific formatting.\n*   Sentence Segmentation: Breaking a paragraph into individual sentences, typically using punctuation marks as delimiters.\n*   Word Segmentation: Dividing a sentence into individual words, typically using whitespace as a delimiter. This process faces challenges with languages that do not use spaces between words.\n\n**Tokenization**\n\nTokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation. It involves breaking text into small units called tokens. Tokens are the fundamental building blocks for many NLP tasks. Tokenization involves identifying the elementary units within a text, so that the text is easier to process.",

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information."

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",
        "### Many Other Applications…\n\nNLP is pervasive and its applications are surprisingly diverse. A search engine provides more relevant results by indexing web pages and documents in a way that takes meaning into account. Autocomplete uses NLP to predict and complete user input in search engines and mobile keyboards. Spelling correctors, grammar checkers, and style coaches in word processors and browser plugins use NLP to improve writing quality. Chatbots use NLP-driven natural language search to find appropriate responses.\n\nNLP pipelines that generate text are used to compose short replies in chatbots and virtual assistants, and to assemble longer passages of text. The Associated Press uses NLP “robot journalists” to write financial news articles and sporting event reports. Bots compose weather forecasts resembling human-generated forecasts.\n\nNLP spam filters in email programs helped email surpass telephone and fax in the '90s. Spam filters retain their edge in the email cat-and-mouse game, but may be losing in social networks. An estimated 20% of tweets about the 2016 US presidential election were composed by chatbots.\n\nThe following table categorizes NLP applications:\n\n| Category          | Application                                                          |\n| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Search            | Web Documents, Autocomplete                                          |\n| Editing           | Spelling, Grammar, Style                                             |\n| Dialog            | Chatbot, Assistant, Scheduling                                       |\n| Writing           | Index, Concordance, Table of contents                                |\n| Email             | Spam filter, Classification, Prioritization                            |\n| Text mining       | Summarization, Knowledge extraction, Medical diagnoses                 |\n| Law               | Legal inference, Precedent search, Subpoena classification             |\n| News              | Event detection, Fact checking, Headline composition                    |\n| Attribution       | Plagiarism detection, Literary forensics, Style coaching               |\n| Sentiment analysis | Community morale monitoring, Product review triage, Customer care        |\n| Behavior prediction | Finance, Election forecasting, Marketing                              |\n| Creative writing  | Movie scripts, Poetry, Song lyrics                                    |"

        "**Privacy scrubbing**\n\n*   LLMs, as text-generating models, are trained on diverse datasets, which may pose privacy concerns and the risk of inadvertent information disclosure. Training on datasets containing PII can create vulnerabilities that allow models to inadvertently reveal sensitive information.\n*   It is imperative to address privacy concerns by systematically removing any sensitive information. This proactive approach helps to mitigate the risk of unintended data breaches and protect individuals' privacy.\n*   This involves employing techniques such as anonymization, redaction, or tokenization to eliminate personally identifiable details, geolocation, and confidential data. These techniques transform or remove sensitive information while preserving the utility of the data for training purposes.\n*   By carefully scrubbing the dataset of such sensitive content, researchers and developers can ensure that the language models trained on these datasets uphold privacy standards and mitigate the risk of unintentional disclosure of private information. Adhering to privacy standards fosters trust and promotes the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Filtering out toxic and biased text**\n\n*   In the preprocessing steps of language datasets, a critical consideration is the removal of toxic and biased content to ensure the development of fair and unbiased language models. Addressing toxicity and bias is essential for creating LLMs that align with human values and promote responsible use.\n*   This involves implementing robust content moderation techniques, such as employing sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and bias identification algorithms. These algorithms are designed to automatically identify and flag text that exhibits harmful or inappropriate characteristics.\n*   By leveraging these tools, it is possible to systematically identify and filter out text that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, offensive language, or biased viewpoints. This process helps to create more inclusive and equitable training datasets, fostering fairness and reducing the risk of perpetuating harmful biases.",
        "**Data pre-processing**\n\n*   Once an adequate corpus of data is collected, the subsequent step is data preprocessing, whose quality directly impacts the model’s performance and security. Proper data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and ethical behavior of LLMs.\n*   The specific preprocessing steps involve filtering low-quality text, including eliminating toxic and biased content to ensure the model aligns with human ethical standards. Content moderation techniques are used to identify and remove harmful or inappropriate text from the training data.\n*   It also includes deduplication, removing duplicates in the training set, and excluding redundant content in the test set to maintain the sample distribution balance. Deduplication helps to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n*   Privacy scrubbing is applied to ensure the model’s security, preventing information leakage or other privacy-related concerns. This involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data from the training corpus.\n\n**Quality filtering**\n\n*   Filtering low-quality data is typically done using heuristic-based methods or classifier-based methods. Both techniques aim to remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from the training data.\n*   Heuristic methods involve employing manually defined rules to eliminate low-quality data. For instance, rules could be set to retain only text containing digits, discard sentences composed entirely of uppercase letters, and remove files with a symbol and word ratio exceeding 0.1, and so forth. These rules are based on common characteristics of low-quality text and require careful tuning to avoid inadvertently filtering out valid data.\n*   Classifier-based methods involve training a classifier on a high-quality dataset to filter out low-quality datasets. The classifier learns to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality text, enabling automated filtering of large corpora. This approach requires a labeled dataset of high-quality and low-quality text for training the classifier.\n\n**Deduplication**\n\n*   Language models may sometimes repetitively generate the same content during text generation, potentially due to a high degree of repetition in the training data. Redundancy in the training data can lead to unintended memorization and replication of specific text patterns.\n*   Extensive repetition can lead to training instability, resulting in a decline in the performance of LLMs. Uncontrolled repetition can hinder the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new inputs.\n*   Additionally, it is crucial to consider avoiding dataset contamination by removing duplicated data present in both the training and test set. Overlapping training and test data can lead to artificially inflated performance metrics and hinder the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.",
        "**Datasets and data pre-processing**\n\n**Datasets**\n\n*   Training LLMs requires vast amounts of text data, and the quality of this data significantly impacts LLM performance. The quantity and quality of data used to train LLMs are directly correlated to their performance, generalization, and bias.\n*   Pre-training on large-scale corpora provides LLMs with a fundamental understanding of language and some generative capability. Exposure to diverse textual patterns, grammar rules, and semantic relationships allows LLMs to acquire a general understanding of language structure and usage.\n*   Pre-training data sources are diverse, commonly incorporating web text, conversational data, and books as general pre-training corpora. Different data sources contribute unique characteristics and biases to the model, affecting its overall behavior.\n*   Leveraging diverse sources of text data for LLM training can significantly enhance the model’s generalization capabilities. By learning from a wide range of textual styles, domains, and perspectives, LLMs can better adapt to unseen data and perform well across various tasks.\n\n| LLMs        | Datasets                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| GPT-3       | CommonCrawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2, Wikipedia                                                                                 |\n| LLaMA       | CommonCrawl, C4, Wikipedia, Github, Books, Arxiv, StackExchange                                                                  |\n| PaLM        | Social Media, Webpages, Books, Github, Wikipedia, News (total 780B tokens)                                                        |\n| T5          | C4, WebText, Wikipedia, RealNews                                                                                                  |\n| CodeGen     | the Pile, BIGQUERY, BIGPYTHON                                                                                                       |\n| CodeGeex    | CodeParrot, the Pile, Github                                                                                                        |\n| GLM         | BooksCorpus, Wikipedia                                                                                                            |\n| BLOOM       | ROOTS                                                                                                                               |\n| OPT         | BookCorpus, CCNews, CC-Stories, the Pile, Pushshift.io                                                                              |\n\n| Corpora       | Type          | Links                                                                       |\n| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| BookCorpus    | Books         | [https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus](https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus) |\n| Gutenberg     | Books         | [https://www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org)                       |\n| Books1        | Books         | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| Books2        | Books         | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| CommonCrawl   | CommonCrawl   | [https://commoncrawl.org](https://commoncrawl.org)                           |\n| C4            | CommonCrawl   | [https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4) |\n| CC-Stories    | CommonCrawl   | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| CC-News       | CommonCrawl   | [https://commoncrawl.org/blog/news-dataset-available](https://commoncrawl.org/blog/news-dataset-available)  |\n| RealNews      | CommonCrawl   | [https://github.com/rowanz/grover/tree/master/realnews](https://github.com/rowanz/grover/tree/master/realnews)    |\n| RefinedWeb    | CommonCrawl   | [https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) |\n| WebText       | Reddit Link   | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| OpenWebtext   | Reddit Link   | [https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/) |\n| PushShift.io  | Reddit Link   |                                                                             |\n| Wikipedia     | Wikipedia     | [https://dumps.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/latest/](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/latest/) |",
        "**Pre-training of LLMs**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) heavily rely on unstructured data for pre-training. Pre-training is the process of training a large model on a massive dataset to learn general language representations.\n\n**Self-supervised pre-training:**\n\n*   Pre-training a large language model is typically done in a self-supervised way, meaning it is trained on unlabeled data, which is usually just text scraped from the internet.\n*   There is no need to assign labels to the dataset manually. Instead, the model learns from the inherent structure of the language itself. If there is no explicit supervision in the data, the model creates its own supervised tasks and solves them.\n\nDifferent self-supervised pre-training methods exist:\n\n*   **Autoencoding (MLM - Masked Language Modeling):** Models based on autoencoding, like BERT, consist primarily of an encoder. During training, a certain percentage of the input words are masked. The model's task is to predict the masked words based on the surrounding context. This bi-directional approach allows the model to gain knowledge of the entire context of the sentence.\n*   **Autoregressive (CLM - Causal Language Modeling):** Autoregressive models, such as GPT, consist of a decoder. They predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. This approach is excellent for text generation tasks, as it naturally simulates the process of writing or speaking. The model predicts the masked word from the preceding words only.\n*   **Seq2Seq (Span Corruption):** Seq2Seq models, like T5, use both an encoder and a decoder. In training, random spans of the input text are masked and replaced with a unique sentinel token. The decoder then predicts the masked spans, with the sentinel token preceding the predicted tokens. This approach forces the model to both understand the context and generate text. In summary, seq2seq models both need to understand the context and generate a text.\n\n**Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\n\nMLM, used in models like BERT, involves feeding input text with randomly masked tokens into a Transformer encoder. The goal is to predict the masked tokens. As an example, consider the original text sequence \"I\", \"love\", \"this\", \"red\", \"car\". This sequence is prepended with the \"<cls>\" (classification) token, and the token \"love\" is randomly replaced with the \"<mask>\" token. The model then minimizes the cross-entropy loss between the masked token \"love\" and its prediction during pre-training.\n\n**Next Token Prediction (Causal Language Modeling)**\n\nNext Token Prediction involves training a model to predict the next word in a sequence. Any text can be used for this task, requiring only the prediction of the next word. This method is primarily used to train autoregressive models like GPT.\n\n**Span Corruption**\n\nIn Span Corruption, a technique utilized in models like T5, some words in the original text are dropped out and replaced with a unique sentinel token. Words are dropped out independently and uniformly at random. The model is then trained to predict the sentinel tokens to delineate the dropped out text.\n\nFor example:\n\nOriginal text: Thank you for inviting me to your party last week.\n\nInputs: Thank you <X> me to your party <Y> week.\n\nTargets: <X> for inviting <Y> last <Z>",
        "`\n\n**Additional Contextual Insights:**\n\n**Hardening NLP Software:** It is crucial to harden your NLP software to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text. Creating \"bug bounties\" incentivizes users to find gaps in your guardrails, turning adversarial curiosity into productive feedback. Open source frameworks, like Guardrails-ai, offer configurable rule templates, acting as real-time unit tests for your system.\n\n**Machine Learning Classifiers:** Traditional machine learning classifiers are effective in detecting malicious intent or inappropriate content in LLM outputs. To prevent the provision of regulated advice (e.g., legal or medical), custom ML models generalize from examples, providing high reliability.

Red teams attempt to bypass guardrails to expose vulnerabilities in the LLM.\n\n**AI Safety and Ethics:** Designating engineers or teams to test and penetrate LLM guardrails, often called \"jail-breaking\" or \"hacking,\" identifies weaknesses. Balancing this effort with an LLM \"blue team\" (engineers and data analysts) enhances defense against undesirable behavior. Constant vigilance and updating guardrails are essential. Bug bounties or red team approaches help stay ahead of toxic content.\n\n**Scaling LLMs:** Scaling LLMs involves increasing data and neurons to improve performance.

        "**Privacy scrubbing**\n\n*   LLMs, as text-generating models, are trained on diverse datasets, which may pose privacy concerns and the risk of inadvertent information disclosure. Training on datasets containing PII can create vulnerabilities that allow models to inadvertently reveal sensitive information.\n*   It is imperative to address privacy concerns by systematically removing any sensitive information. This proactive approach helps to mitigate the risk of unintended data breaches and protect individuals' privacy.\n*   This involves employing techniques such as anonymization, redaction, or tokenization to eliminate personally identifiable details, geolocation, and confidential data. These techniques transform or remove sensitive information while preserving the utility of the data for training purposes.\n*   By carefully scrubbing the dataset of such sensitive content, researchers and developers can ensure that the language models trained on these datasets uphold privacy standards and mitigate the risk of unintentional disclosure of private information. Adhering to privacy standards fosters trust and promotes the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Filtering out toxic and biased text**\n\n*   In the preprocessing steps of language datasets, a critical consideration is the removal of toxic and biased content to ensure the development of fair and unbiased language models. Addressing toxicity and bias is essential for creating LLMs that align with human values and promote responsible use.\n*   This involves implementing robust content moderation techniques, such as employing sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and bias identification algorithms. These algorithms are designed to automatically identify and flag text that exhibits harmful or inappropriate characteristics.\n*   By leveraging these tools, it is possible to systematically identify and filter out text that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, offensive language, or biased viewpoints. This process helps to create more inclusive and equitable training datasets, fostering fairness and reducing the risk of perpetuating harmful biases.",
        "**Data pre-processing**\n\n*   Once an adequate corpus of data is collected, the subsequent step is data preprocessing, whose quality directly impacts the model’s performance and security. Proper data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and ethical behavior of LLMs.\n*   The specific preprocessing steps involve filtering low-quality text, including eliminating toxic and biased content to ensure the model aligns with human ethical standards. Content moderation techniques are used to identify and remove harmful or inappropriate text from the training data.\n*   It also includes deduplication, removing duplicates in the training set, and excluding redundant content in the test set to maintain the sample distribution balance. Deduplication helps to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n*   Privacy scrubbing is applied to ensure the model’s security, preventing information leakage or other privacy-related concerns. This involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data from the training corpus.\n\n**Quality filtering**\n\n*   Filtering low-quality data is typically done using heuristic-based methods or classifier-based methods. Both techniques aim to remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from the training data.\n*   Heuristic methods involve employing manually defined rules to eliminate low-quality data. For instance, rules could be set to retain only text containing digits, discard sentences composed entirely of uppercase letters, and remove files with a symbol and word ratio exceeding 0.1, and so forth. These rules are based on common characteristics of low-quality text and require careful tuning to avoid inadvertently filtering out valid data.\n*   Classifier-based methods involve training a classifier on a high-quality dataset to filter out low-quality datasets. The classifier learns to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality text, enabling automated filtering of large corpora. This approach requires a labeled dataset of high-quality and low-quality text for training the classifier.\n\n**Deduplication**\n\n*   Language models may sometimes repetitively generate the same content during text generation, potentially due to a high degree of repetition in the training data. Redundancy in the training data can lead to unintended memorization and replication of specific text patterns.\n*   Extensive repetition can lead to training instability, resulting in a decline in the performance of LLMs. Uncontrolled repetition can hinder the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new inputs.\n*   Additionally, it is crucial to consider avoiding dataset contamination by removing duplicated data present in both the training and test set. Overlapping training and test data can lead to artificially inflated performance metrics and hinder the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.",
        "**Datasets and data pre-processing**\n\n**Datasets**\n\n*   Training LLMs requires vast amounts of text data, and the quality of this data significantly impacts LLM performance. The quantity and quality of data used to train LLMs are directly correlated to their performance, generalization, and bias.\n*   Pre-training on large-scale corpora provides LLMs with a fundamental understanding of language and some generative capability. Exposure to diverse textual patterns, grammar rules, and semantic relationships allows LLMs to acquire a general understanding of language structure and usage.\n*   Pre-training data sources are diverse, commonly incorporating web text, conversational data, and books as general pre-training corpora. Different data sources contribute unique characteristics and biases to the model, affecting its overall behavior.\n*   Leveraging diverse sources of text data for LLM training can significantly enhance the model’s generalization capabilities. By learning from a wide range of textual styles, domains, and perspectives, LLMs can better adapt to unseen data and perform well across various tasks.\n\n| LLMs        | Datasets                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| GPT-3       | CommonCrawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2, Wikipedia                                                                                 |\n| LLaMA       | CommonCrawl, C4, Wikipedia, Github, Books, Arxiv, StackExchange                                                                  |\n| PaLM        | Social Media, Webpages, Books, Github, Wikipedia, News (total 780B tokens)                                                        |\n| T5          | C4, WebText, Wikipedia, RealNews                                                                                                  |\n| CodeGen     | the Pile, BIGQUERY, BIGPYTHON                                                                                                       |\n| CodeGeex    | CodeParrot, the Pile, Github                                                                                                        |\n| GLM         | BooksCorpus, Wikipedia                                                                                                            |\n| BLOOM       | ROOTS                                                                                                                               |\n| OPT         | BookCorpus, CCNews, CC-Stories, the Pile, Pushshift.io                                                                              |\n\n| Corpora       | Type          | Links                                                                       |\n| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| BookCorpus    | Books         | [https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus](https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus) |\n| Gutenberg     | Books         | [https://www.gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org)                       |\n| Books1        | Books         | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| Books2        | Books         | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| CommonCrawl   | CommonCrawl   | [https://commoncrawl.org](https://commoncrawl.org)                           |\n| C4            | CommonCrawl   | [https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4) |\n| CC-Stories    | CommonCrawl   | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| CC-News       | CommonCrawl   | [https://commoncrawl.org/blog/news-dataset-available](https://commoncrawl.org/blog/news-dataset-available)  |\n| RealNews      | CommonCrawl   | [https://github.com/rowanz/grover/tree/master/realnews](https://github.com/rowanz/grover/tree/master/realnews)    |\n| RefinedWeb    | CommonCrawl   | [https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) |\n| WebText       | Reddit Link   | Not open source yet                                                         |\n| OpenWebtext   | Reddit Link   | [https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/) |\n| PushShift.io  | Reddit Link   |                                                                             |\n| Wikipedia     | Wikipedia     | [https://dumps.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/latest/](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/latest/) |",
        "`\n\n**Types of Guardrails:**\n\n*   **Safety Guardrails:** These are designed to prevent the generation of harmful, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate content. They serve to protect users from exposure to toxic language or dangerous advice. This might include filtering hate speech, violent content, or sexually suggestive material.\n*   **Domain-Specific Guardrails:** Domain-specific guardrails restrict the LLM’s responses to specific knowledge areas. This ensures that the model provides accurate and relevant information within a defined context. For instance, an LLM used in a legal context should only provide information related to law and legal precedents.\n*   **Ethical Guardrails:** These guardrails aim to avoid bias, misinformation, and ensure fairness in LLM outputs. This is important for promoting ethical AI practices and preventing discriminatory results. Ethical guardrails involve careful data curation and monitoring of model outputs to identify and correct biases.\n*   **Operational Guardrails:** Operational guardrails limit LLM outputs to align with specific business or user objectives. This is essential for tailoring the LLM’s behavior to meet particular goals, such as customer service or lead generation. These involve setting specific parameters and constraints that guide the LLM's responses.\n\n`",

This allows chatbots to respond in a manner consistent with the designer's intent.\n\nMost chatbot frameworks rely on declarative programming languages to define a bot's behavior, and some offer graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for programming. No-code chatbot frameworks further simplify this by abstracting the declarative language with interactive graphical representations of dialog graphs, allowing modifications via mouse interactions. These frameworks often include a dialog engine that can execute the chatbot without requiring direct manipulation of the underlying data.\n\nExamples of chatbot frameworks include RapidPro, sponsored by UNICEF, which has served as the foundation for platforms like Weni, Textit, and Glific, all utilized for impactful applications. RapidPro offers a GUI for building dialogs and supports importing and exporting content using open standard file formats, facilitating multilingual chatbot development. Other closed-source no-code builders with similar functionality include ManyChat and Landbot.\n\nHowever, for more sophisticated chatbot designs, a chatbot programming language becomes necessary to realize complex visions. While Python can be used directly, a chatbot framework that uses a dedicated design language or data structure is essential for building scalable and maintainable chatbots. A suitable language allows developers to quickly translate conversation designs into working chatbots."

This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language.

This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts.

        "different approaches; we show you techniques for both.\n\nIn addition, deep learning and data-driven programming (machine learning, or probabilistic language modeling) have rapidly diversified the possible applications for NLP and chatbots. This data-driven approach allows ever greater sophistication for an NLP pipeline by providing it with greater and greater amounts of data in the domain you want to apply it to. And when a new machine learning approach is discovered that makes even better use of this data, with more efficient model generalization or regularization, then large jumps in capability are possible.\n\nThe NLP pipeline for a chatbot shown in Figure 1.4 contains all the building blocks for most of the NLP applications that we described at the start of this chapter. As in Taming Text, we break out our pipeline into four main subsystems or stages. In addition, we have explicitly called out a database to record data required for each of these stages and persist their configuration and training sets over time. This can enable batch or online retraining of each of the stages as the chatbot interacts with the world. We have also shown a \"feedback loop\" on our generated text responses so that our responses can be processed using the same algorithms used to process the user statements. The response \"scores\" or features can then be combined in an objective function to evaluate and select the best possible response, depending on the chatbot’s plan or goals for the dialog. This book is focused on configuring this NLP pipeline for a chatbot, but you may also be able to see the analogy to the NLP problem of text retrieval or \"search,\" perhaps the most common NLP application. And our chatbot pipeline is certainly appropriate for the question-answering application that was the focus of Taming Text.\n\nThe application of this pipeline to financial forecasting or business analytics may not be so obvious. But imagine the features generated by the analysis portion of your pipeline. These features of your analysis or feature generation can be optimized for your particular finance or business prediction. That way they can help you incorporate natural language data into a machine learning pipeline for forecasting. Despite focusing on building a chatbot, this book gives you the tools you need for a broad range of NLP applications, from search to financial forecasting.\n\nOne processing element in Figure 1.4 that is not typically employed in search, forecasting, or question-answering systems is natural language generation. For chatbots, this is their central feature. Nonetheless, the text generation step is often incorporated into a search engine NLP application and can give such an engine a large competitive advantage. The ability to consolidate or summarize search results is a winning feature for many popular search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google). And you can imagine how valuable it is for a financial forecasting engine to be able to generate statements, tweets, or entire articles based on the business-actionable events it detects in natural language streams from social media networks and news feeds.\n\nThe next section shows how the layers of such a system can be combined to create greater sophistication and capability at each stage of the NLP pipeline.\n\n### 1.10 Processing in depth\nThe stages of a natural language processing pipeline can be thought of as layers, like the layers in a feed-forward neural network. Deep learning is all about creating more complex models and behavior by adding additional processing layers to the conventional two-layer machine learning model architecture of feature extraction followed by modeling. In Chapter 5 we explain how neural networks help spread the learning across layers by backpropagating model errors from the output layers back to the input layers. But here we talk about the top layers and what can be done by training each layer independently of the other layers.\n\nFigure 1.8 Example layers for an NLP pipeline\nThe top four layers in Figure 1.8 correspond to the first two stages in the chatbot pipeline (feature extraction and feature analysis) in the previous section. For example, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging), is one way to generate features within the Analyze stage of our chatbot pipeline. POS tags are generated automatically by the default SpaCY pipeline, which includes all the top four layers in this diagram. POS tagging is typically accomplished with a finite state transducer like the methods in the nltk.tag package.\n\nThe bottom two layers (Entity Relationships and a Knowledge Base) are used to populate a database containing information (knowledge) about a particular domain. And the information extracted from a particular statement or document using all six of these layers can then be used in combination with that database to make inferences. Inferences are logical extrapolations from a set of conditions detected in the environment, like the logic contained in the statement of a chatbot user. This kind of \"inference engine\" in the deeper layers of this diagram is considered the domain of artificial intelligence, where machines can make inferences about their world and use those inferences to make logical decisions. However, chatbots can make reasonable decisions without this knowledge database, using only the algorithms of the upper few layers. And these decisions can combine to produce surprisingly human-like behaviors.\n\nOver the next few chapters, we dive down through the top few layers of NLP. The top three layers are all that is required to perform meaningful sentiment analysis and semantic search and to build human-mimicking chatbots. In fact, it’s possible to build a useful and interesting chatbot using only a single layer of processing, using the text (character sequences) directly as the features for a language model. A chatbot that only does string matching and search is capable of participating in a reasonably convincing conversation if given enough example statements and responses.\n\nFor example, the open source project ChatterBot simplifies this pipeline by merely computing the string \"edit distance\" (Levenshtein distance) between an input statement and the statements recorded in its database. If its database of statement-response pairs contains a matching statement, the corresponding reply (from a previously \"learned\" human or machine dialog) can be reused as the reply to the latest user statement. For this pipeline, all that is required is step 3 (Generate) of our chatbot pipeline. And within this stage, only a brute-force search algorithm is required to find the best response. With this simple technique (no tokenization or feature generation required), ChatterBot can maintain a convincing conversion as the dialog engine for Salvius, a mechanical robot built from salvaged parts by Gunther Cox.\n[\n65\n]\nWill is an open source Python chatbot framework by Steven Skoczen with a completely different approach.\n[\n66\n]\nWill can only be trained to respond to statements by programming it with regular expressions. This is the labor-intensive and data-light approach to NLP. This grammar-based approach is especially effective for question-answering systems and task-execution assistant bots, like Lex, Siri, and Google Now. These kinds of systems overcome the \"brittleness\" of regular expressions by employing \"fuzzy regular expressions.\"footnote:[The Python regex package is backward compatible with re and adds fuzziness among other features. The regex will replace the re package in future Python versions\n(\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n).\nSimilarly TRE agrep, or \"approximate grep,\" (\nhttps://github.com/laurikari/tre\n)\nis an alternative to the UNIX command-line application grep.] and other techniques for finding approximate grammar matches. Fuzzy regular expressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible grammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring social media. If you need it to respond in real-time, without continuous monitoring by humans, you will need to think about ways to prevent it from saying things that harm your business, your reputation, or your users. You’ll need to do more than simply connect your users directly to the LLM.",

        "1.11 Natural language IQ\nLike human brainpower, the power of an NLP pipeline cannot be easily\ngauged with a single IQ score without considering multiple \"smarts\"\ndimensions. A common way to measure the capability of a robotic system is\nalong the dimensions of behavior complexity and the degree of human\nsupervision required. But for a natural language processing pipeline, the goal\nis to build systems that fully automate the processing of natural language,\neliminating all human supervision (once the model is trained and deployed).\nSo a better pair of IQ dimensions should capture the breadth and depth of the\ncomplexity of the natural language pipeline.\nA consumer product chatbot or virtual assistant like Alexa or Allo is usually\ndesigned to have extremely broad knowledge and capabilities. However, the\nlogic used to respond to requests tends to be shallow, often consisting of a set\nof trigger phrases that all produce the same response with a single if-then\ndecision branch. Alexa (and the underlying Lex engine) behave like a single\nlayer, flat tree of (if, elif, elif, …) statements.\n[\n68\n]\n Google Dialogflow (which\nwas developed independently of Google’s Allo and Google Assistant) has\nsimilar capabilities to Amazon Lex, Contact Flow, and Lambda, but without\nthe drag-and-drop user interface for designing your dialog tree.\nOn the other hand, the Google Translate pipeline (or any similar machine\ntranslation system) relies on a deep tree of feature extractors, decision trees,\nand knowledge graphs connecting bits of knowledge about the world.\nSometimes these feature extractors, decision trees, and knowledge graphs are\nexplicitly programmed into the system, as in Figure 1.5. Another approach\nrapidly overtaking this \"hand-coded\" pipeline is the deep learning data-driven\napproach. Feature extractors for deep neural networks are learned rather than\nhard-coded, but they often require much more training data to achieve the\nsame performance as intentionally designed algorithms.\nYou will use both approaches (neural networks and hand-coded algorithms)\nas you incrementally build an NLP pipeline for a chatbot capable of\nconversing within a focused knowledge domain. This will give you the skills\nyou need to accomplish the natural language processing tasks within your\nindustry or business domain. Along the way you will probably get ideas\nabout how to expand the breadth of things this NLP pipeline can do. Figure\n1.6 puts the chatbot in its place among the natural language processing\nsystems that are already out there. Imagine the chatbots you have interacted\nwith. Where do you think they might fit in a plot like this? Have you\nattempted to gauge their intelligence by probing them with difficult questions\nor something like an IQ test? Try asking a chatbot something ambiguous that\nrequires common sense logic and the ability to ask clarifying questions, such\nas \"What’s larger, the sun or a nickel?\"\n[\n69\n]\n you will get a chance to do exactly\nthat in later chapters, to help you decide how your chatbot stacks up against\nsome of the others in this diagram.\nFigure 1.9 2D IQ of some natural language processing systems\nAs you progress through this book, you will be building the elements of a\nchatbot. Chatbots require all the tools of NLP to work well:\nFeature extraction (usually to produce a vector space model)\nInformation extraction to be able to answer factual questions\nSemantic search to learn from previously recorded natural language text\nor dialog\nNatural language generation to compose new, meaningful statements\nMachine learning gives us a way to trick machines into behaving as if we had\nspent a lifetime programming them with hundreds of complex regular\nexpressions or algorithms. We can teach a machine to respond to patterns\nsimilar to the patterns defined in regular expressions by merely providing it\nexamples of user statements and the responses we want the chatbot to mimic.\nAnd the \"models\" of language, the FSMs, produced by machine learning, are\nmuch better. They are less picky about mispelings and typoz.\nAnd machine learning NLP pipelines are easier to \"program.\" We do not\nhave to anticipate every possible use of symbols in our language. We just\nhave to feed the training pipeline with examples of the phrases that match and\nwith example phrases that do not match. As long as we label the example\nphrases during training so that the chatbot knows which is which, it will learn\nto discriminate between them. And there are even machine learning\napproaches that require little if any \"labeled\" data.\nWe have given you some exciting reasons to learn about natural language\nprocessing. You want to help save the world, do you not? And we have\nattempted to pique your interest with some practical NLP applications that\nare revolutionizing the way we communicate, learn, do business, and even\nthink. It will not be long before you are able to build a system that\napproaches human-like conversational behavior. And you should be able to\nsee in upcoming chapters how to train a chatbot or NLP pipeline with any\ndomain knowledge that interests you — from finance and sports to\npsychology and literature. If you can find a corpus of writing about it, then\nyou can train a machine to understand it.\nThis book is about using machine learning to build smart text-reading\nmachines without you having to anticipate all the ways people can say things.\nEach chapter incrementally improves on the basic NLP pipeline for the\nchatbot introduced in this chapter. As you learn the tools of natural language\nprocessing, you will be building an NLP pipeline that can not only carry on a\nconversation but help you accomplish your goals in business and in life."

        "**Hints and Implementation Details**\n\nTo initiate the project, create the necessary directory and initialize a Rasa project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir pizzaBot\ncd pizzaBot\nrasa init --no-prompt\n```\n\nThis series of commands first creates a directory named `pizzaBot`, then navigates into it. Inside this directory, `rasa init --no-prompt` initializes a new Rasa project without prompting for user input. This is a quick way to set up the basic project structure. Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework, which is helpful when building a chatbot with configurable NLP capabilities.\n\nNext, configure and run the REST and Actions servers:\n\n```bash\nrasa run --cors \"*\"\nrasa run actions\n```\n\nThe first command, `rasa run --cors \"*\"`, starts the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for all origins. This setting is mainly for development purposes to allow web frontends hosted on different domains to communicate with the Rasa server. The second command, `rasa run actions`, launches the actions server. This server executes custom Python code (actions) which are used to extend the bot's functionality, such as logging the order details in this scenario.\n\nTo create the web frontend of this project, consider using a web widget such as the one available at:\n\n[https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0)\n\nThis widget provides a ready-made interface that can be integrated with the Rasa chatbot.",

It enables LLMs to adapt to new tasks and datasets with minimal training.\n\nElements of a prompt context include:\n\n*   **Reference Material:** Specific texts or data used to perform the task.\n*   **Input-Output Pairs:** Examples of the task to illustrate the desired pattern, guiding the model with concrete instances.\n*   **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Detailed guidance for completing the task, providing a clear process for the model to follow.\n*   **Clarifications:** Addressing potential ambiguities in the task to minimize misinterpretations.\n*   **Templates:** Structures or placeholders to be filled in, providing a framework for the model to generate structured outputs.\n\nPrompt engineering heavily relies on in-context learning to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs.\n\n`",
        "`\n\n### Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n\n**Prompt Engineering:** This is a relatively new discipline that focuses on the design and optimization of prompts used to interact with LLMs. The aim is to effectively leverage LLMs for a wide array of applications and research endeavors. Effective prompt engineering is essential because LLMs respond differently based on the input prompts they receive. Optimizing these prompts can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the output.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n*   **Enhances understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations:** By experimenting with different prompts, engineers gain insights into what LLMs can and cannot do. This understanding is crucial for setting realistic expectations and identifying appropriate use cases.\n*   **Improves LLM performance on a broad range of tasks:** Optimized prompts can enhance the accuracy, coherence, and relevance of LLM outputs across various tasks, including question answering and arithmetic reasoning.\n*   **Helps interfacing with LLMs and integrating with other tools:** Prompt engineering facilitates the integration of LLMs into broader workflows and systems, allowing them to interact seamlessly with other software and data sources.\n*   **Enables new capabilities:** Well-crafted prompts can unlock new functionalities in LLMs, such as augmenting them with domain-specific knowledge and external resources, thereby extending their applicability.\n\n`",
        "### Prompt Engineering Techniques\n\n*   **Generate Knowledge Prompting:**\n    *   Definition: First prompts the LLM to generate relevant knowledge related to a task, then incorporates that knowledge into the prompt along with the task description or question.\n    *   Principle: Leverages the LLM's capacity to generate supplementary knowledge beyond its base training domain. Useful when the LLM lacks the specific information required to directly answer a query.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```\n        List and describe the key factors that influence the evolution of life in\n        environments with extreme gravitational forces, such as on a super-Earth\n        planet. Focus on biological, physiological, and ecological adaptations\n        that might arise in such conditions.\n\n        Using the adaptations and factors you described earlier, design a\n        hypothetical intelligent species that could evolve on a super-Earth planet\n        with extreme gravitational forces. Include details about their physical\n        structure, social behaviors, methods of tool use or communication, and how\n        their adaptations influence their culture or technology.\n        ```",
        "`\n\n**Prompt Engineering:**\n\n**Definition:** Prompt engineering is the process of crafting or refining prompts to guide the LLM's behavior within desired boundaries. By carefully designing prompts, developers can influence the model's responses and steer it away from undesirable outputs.\n\n**Method:** Prompts are designed in a way that encourages the LLM to produce outputs that are factual, non-controversial, and aligned with ethical guidelines.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   **Factual Information:** Using prompts like \"Respond only with factual, non-controversial information.\" This encourages the model to stick to verified information and avoid speculative or unverified statements.\n*   **Avoiding Speculation:** Using prompts that instruct the model to \"Avoid speculative or unverifiable statements.\" This helps maintain credibility and reduces the risk of generating misleading content.\n\n`",

Briefly explain how you recognized the type.\n\n            2. Apply an Appropriate Method: Based on the type, outline the most suitable method for\n            solving it (e.g., separation of variables, integrating factor, etc.). If there are multiple\n            approaches, describe why this particular method is the best choice.\n\n            3. Show Step-by-Step Solution: Work through the equation step-by-step, explaining each\n            manipulation and transformation in clear terms.\n\n            4. Verify Solution: Once you find the solution, verify it by differentiating the result and\n            substituting it back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the differential equation.\n\n            5. Summarize the Solution: Finally, summarize the general or particular solution, highlighting\n\n            any constants or special conditions that apply.\n            ```"

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",

        "**Paradigm shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a significant paradigm shift in NLP, altering the traditional approaches to problem-solving and model design.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** A significant portion of NLP work involved manually crafting or selecting the most relevant features for a specific task. This required deep domain knowledge and was often a time-consuming and iterative process.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model for a given task was crucial. Different models excelled at different tasks, requiring careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the model's capabilities.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** When labeled data was scarce, transfer learning techniques were used to leverage knowledge from other domains. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity and capacity to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance was a primary concern. Regularization techniques and cross-validation were essential tools.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of language. This pre-trained knowledge is then fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets for specific tasks, significantly reducing the need for task-specific feature engineering. This allows for leveraging vast amounts of previously under-utilized unlabeled data.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs exhibit the remarkable ability to perform on tasks they were not explicitly trained on. Zero-shot learning refers to performing a task without any task-specific training examples. Few-shot learning involves providing only a handful of examples to guide the model.\n*   **Prompting:** Instead of extensive fine-tuning, LLMs can be instructed to perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. The way the prompt is designed significantly impacts the model's performance. Prompt engineering has become a key skill in leveraging LLMs.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and how they arrive at their decisions is a growing area of research. The complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to interpret their behavior, but understanding their decision-making process is crucial for building trust and addressing potential biases.\n\nThis paradigm shift is primarily driven by the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences. Information loss during encoding and the sequential nature of processing hindered parallel training and favored late timestep inputs.\n\nThe **Attention mechanism** emerged as a solution, offering:\n\n*   **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to directly attend to relevant parts of the input, regardless of their distance.\n*   **Parallel training:** Attention enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly accelerating training.\n*   **Dynamic attention weights based on inputs:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights based on the relevance of different parts of the input, allowing the model to focus on the most important information.",

        "## Additional Context\n\nHere is further relevant context to the topic covered.\n\nPopular sampling techniques that are often used in practice are top-k sampling and nucleus sampling. We won’t discuss all of them here - you can read more about them in HuggingFace’s excellent guide.\n[\n26\n]\nLet’s try to generate text using nucleus sampling method. In this method, instead of choosing among the K most likely words, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is smaller than p. So if there are only a few candidates with large probabilities, the \"nucleus\" would be smaller, than in the case of larger group of candidates with smaller probabilities. Note that because sampling is probabilistic, the generated text will be different for you - this is not something that can be controlled with a random seed.\n\nListing 10.7 Generating text using nucleus sampling method\n```python\n>>> nucleus_sampling_args = {\n...    'do_sample': True,\n...    'max_length': 50,\n...    'top_p': 0.92\n... }\n>>> print(generate(prompt='NLP is a', **nucleus_sampling_args))\n```\nNLP is a multi-level network protocol, which is one of the most well-documented protocols for managing data transfer protocols. This is useful if one can perform network transfers using one data transfer protocol and another protocol or protocol in the same chain.\nOK. This is better, but still not quite what you were looking for. Your output still uses the same words too much (just count how many times \"protocol\" was mentioned!) But more importantly, though NLP indeed can stand for Network Layer Protocol, it’s not what you were looking for. To get generated text that is domain-specific, you need to fine-tune our model - that means, to train it on a dataset that is specific to our task.\n\n### 10.1.7 Fine-tuning your generative model\nIn your case, this dataset would be this very book, parsed into a database of lines. Let’s load it from nlpia2 repository. In this case, we only need the book’s text, so we’ll ignore code, headers, and all other things that will not be helpful for our generative model.\nLet’s also initialize a new version of our GPT-2 model for finetuning. We can reuse the tokenizer for GPT-2 we initialized before.\n\nListing 10.8 Loading the NLPiA2 lines as training data for GPT-2\n```python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> DATASET_URL = ('https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/'\n...     '-/raw/main/src/nlpia2/data/nlpia_lines.csv')\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_URL)\n>>> df = df[df['is_text']]\n>>> lines = df.line_text.copy()\n```\n\nThis will read all the sentences of natural language text in the manuscript for this book. Each line or sentence will be a different \"document\" in your NLP pipeline, so your model will learn how to generate sentences rather than longer passages. You want to wrap your list of sentences with a PyTorch Dataset class so that your text will be structured in the way that our training pipeline expects.\n\nListing 10.9 Creating a PyTorch Dataset for training\n```python\n>>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n>>> from torch.utils.data import random_split\n>>> class NLPiADataset(Dataset):\n>>>     def __init__(self, txt_list, tokenizer, max_length=768):\n>>>         self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n>>>         self.input_ids = []\n>>>         self.attn_masks = []\n>>>         for txt in txt_list:\n>>>             encodings_dict = tokenizer(txt, truncation=True,\n...                 max_length=max_length, padding=\"max_length\")\n>>>             self.input_ids.append(\n...                 torch.tensor(encodings_dict['input_ids']))\n>>>     def __len__(self):\n>>>         return len(self.input_ids)\n>>>     def __getitem__(self, idx):\n>>>         return self.input_ids[idx]\n```\nNow, we want to set aside some samples for evaluating our loss mid-training. Usually, we would need to wrap them in the DataLoader wrapper, but luckily, the Transformers package simplifies things for us.\n\nListing 10.10 Creating training and evaluation sets for fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> dataset = NLPiADataset(lines, tokenizer, max_length=768)\n>>> train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))\n>>> eval_size = len(dataset) - train_size\n>>> train_dataset, eval_dataset = random_split(\n...     dataset, [train_size, eval_size])\n```\n\nFinally, you need one more Transformers library object - DataCollator. It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```",

It dynamically builds batches out of our sample, doing some simple pre-prossesing (like padding) in the process. You’ll also define batch size - it will depend on the RAM of your GPU. We suggest starting from single-digit batch sizes and seeing if you run into out-of-memory errors.\n\nIf you were doing the training in PyTorch, there are multiple parameters that you would need to specify - such as the optimizer, its learning rate, and the warmup schedule for adjusting the learning rate. This is how you did it in the previous chapters. This time, we’ll show you how to use the presets that transformers package offers in order to train the model as a part of Trainer class. In this case, we only need to specify the batch size and number of epochs! Easy-peasy.\n\nListing 10.11 Defining training arguments for GPT-2 fine-tuning\n```python\n>>> from nlpia2.constants import DATA_DIR  # #1\n>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\n>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\n...    output_dir=DATA_DIR / 'ch10_checkpoints',\n...    per_device_train_batch_size=5,\n...    num_train_epochs=5,\n...    save_strategy='epoch'\n... )\n>>> collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False\n... )  # #2\n```",

The `header=None` argument indicates that the file does not contain a header row, and `names=['label', 'text']` assigns the column names \"label\" and \"text\" to the SMS message labels and content, respectively. `print(df.head())` displays the first few rows of the dataframe to show the dataset's structure.\n\n### Tokenize and Generate WEs\n```python\nimport spacy\nimport numpy as np\n\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')  # loads the medium model with 300-dimensional WEs\n\n# Tokenize the text and save the WEs\ncorpus = []\nfor sample in df['text']:\n    doc = nlp(sample, disable=[\"tagger\", \"parser\", \"attribute_ruler\", \"lemmatizer\", \"ner\"])  # only tok2vec\n    corpus.append([token.vector for token in doc])\n\n# Pad or truncate samples to a fixed length\nmaxlen = 50\nzero_vec = [0] * len(corpus[0][0])\nfor i in range(len(corpus)):\n    if len(corpus[i]) < maxlen:\n        corpus[i] += [zero_vec] * (maxlen - len(corpus[i]))  # pad\n    else:\n        corpus[i] = corpus[i][:maxlen]  # truncate\n\ncorpus = np.array(corpus)\nprint(corpus.shape) # Expected output: (5572, 50, 300)\n```\n\nThis section prepares the text data for use in a neural network.  It uses the spaCy library to tokenize the SMS messages and generate word embeddings. `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')` loads the 'en_core_web_md' model, which includes 300-dimensional word embeddings. The code then iterates through each SMS message (`df['text']`), tokenizes it using `nlp(sample)`, and extracts the word embedding vector (`token.vector`) for each token. Unnecessary pipeline components are disabled for efficiency. The resulting `corpus` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the word embedding vectors for the tokens in an SMS message. A zero vector of the same dimension as word embeddings represents padding, to ensure that all input sequences have the same length.",
        "## RNN Variants\n\n### Bidirectional RNN\n\nA Bidirectional RNN has two recurrent hidden layers:\n\n*   One processes the input sequence forward.\n*   The other processes the input sequence backward.\n*   The output of those two are concatenated at each time step.\n\nBy processing a sequence both ways, a bidirectional RNN can catch patterns that may be overlooked by a unidirectional RNN.\n\n*   Example: they wanted to pet the dog whose fur was brown\n\nFigure 8.13 (not provided) depicts a Bidirectional recurrent neural net.\n\nThe basic idea is to arrange two RNNs side by side, passing the input into one as normal and the same input backward into the other net. The output of those two are then concatenated at each time step to the related (same input token) time step in the other network. The output of the final time step in the input is concatenated with the output generated by the same input token at the first time step of the backward net.\n\n**TIP:** Keras also has a `go_backwards` keyword argument. If this is set to `True`, Keras automatically flips the input sequences and inputs them into the network in reverse order. This is the second half of a bidirectional layer. A recurrent neural network (due to the vanishing gradients problem) is more receptive to data at the end of the sample than at the beginning. If samples are padded with `<PAD>` tokens at the end, the good information may be buried. `go_backwards` can be a quick way around this problem.",
        "### T5 Pre-training\nT5 is pre-trained using a denoising autoencoder objective called span-corruption. This pre-training task helps the model learn general language understanding and generation skills.\n\nThe span-corruption objective involves masking spans of text (rather than individual tokens) within the input sequence and then training the model to predict those masked spans.\n\n*   **Input Corruption:** Random spans of text in the input are replaced with a special `<extra_id_X>` token (e.g., `<extra_id_0>`, `<extra_id_1>`).\n*   **Original Input:** \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n*   **Corrupted Input:** \"The quick `<extra_id_0>` jumps `<extra_id_1>` dog.\"\n*   **Target Output:** The model is trained to predict the original masked spans in sequential order.\n*   **Target Output:** `<extra_id_0>` brown fox `<extra_id_1>` over the lazy.\n\nThis span-corruption approach forces the model to generate coherent text and learn contextual relationships between tokens. By predicting missing spans, the model learns to understand the relationships between words and phrases.",
        "different approaches; we show you techniques for both.\n\nIn addition, deep learning and data-driven programming (machine learning, or probabilistic language modeling) have rapidly diversified the possible applications for NLP and chatbots. This data-driven approach allows ever greater sophistication for an NLP pipeline by providing it with greater and greater amounts of data in the domain you want to apply it to. And when a new machine learning approach is discovered that makes even better use of this data, with more efficient model generalization or regularization, then large jumps in capability are possible.\n\nThe NLP pipeline for a chatbot shown in Figure 1.4 contains all the building blocks for most of the NLP applications that we described at the start of this chapter. As in Taming Text, we break out our pipeline into four main subsystems or stages. In addition, we have explicitly called out a database to record data required for each of these stages and persist their configuration and training sets over time. This can enable batch or online retraining of each of the stages as the chatbot interacts with the world. We have also shown a \"feedback loop\" on our generated text responses so that our responses can be processed using the same algorithms used to process the user statements. The response \"scores\" or features can then be combined in an objective function to evaluate and select the best possible response, depending on the chatbot’s plan or goals for the dialog. This book is focused on configuring this NLP pipeline for a chatbot, but you may also be able to see the analogy to the NLP problem of text retrieval or \"search,\" perhaps the most common NLP application. And our chatbot pipeline is certainly appropriate for the question-answering application that was the focus of Taming Text.\n\nThe application of this pipeline to financial forecasting or business analytics may not be so obvious. But imagine the features generated by the analysis portion of your pipeline. These features of your analysis or feature generation can be optimized for your particular finance or business prediction. That way they can help you incorporate natural language data into a machine learning pipeline for forecasting. Despite focusing on building a chatbot, this book gives you the tools you need for a broad range of NLP applications, from search to financial forecasting.\n\nOne processing element in Figure 1.4 that is not typically employed in search, forecasting, or question-answering systems is natural language generation. For chatbots, this is their central feature. Nonetheless, the text generation step is often incorporated into a search engine NLP application and can give such an engine a large competitive advantage. The ability to consolidate or summarize search results is a winning feature for many popular search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Google). And you can imagine how valuable it is for a financial forecasting engine to be able to generate statements, tweets, or entire articles based on the business-actionable events it detects in natural language streams from social media networks and news feeds.\n\nThe next section shows how the layers of such a system can be combined to create greater sophistication and capability at each stage of the NLP pipeline.\n\n### 1.10 Processing in depth\nThe stages of a natural language processing pipeline can be thought of as layers, like the layers in a feed-forward neural network. Deep learning is all about creating more complex models and behavior by adding additional processing layers to the conventional two-layer machine learning model architecture of feature extraction followed by modeling. In Chapter 5 we explain how neural networks help spread the learning across layers by backpropagating model errors from the output layers back to the input layers. But here we talk about the top layers and what can be done by training each layer independently of the other layers.\n\nFigure 1.8 Example layers for an NLP pipeline\nThe top four layers in Figure 1.8 correspond to the first two stages in the chatbot pipeline (feature extraction and feature analysis) in the previous section. For example, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging), is one way to generate features within the Analyze stage of our chatbot pipeline. POS tags are generated automatically by the default SpaCY pipeline, which includes all the top four layers in this diagram. POS tagging is typically accomplished with a finite state transducer like the methods in the nltk.tag package.\n\nThe bottom two layers (Entity Relationships and a Knowledge Base) are used to populate a database containing information (knowledge) about a particular domain. And the information extracted from a particular statement or document using all six of these layers can then be used in combination with that database to make inferences. Inferences are logical extrapolations from a set of conditions detected in the environment, like the logic contained in the statement of a chatbot user. This kind of \"inference engine\" in the deeper layers of this diagram is considered the domain of artificial intelligence, where machines can make inferences about their world and use those inferences to make logical decisions. However, chatbots can make reasonable decisions without this knowledge database, using only the algorithms of the upper few layers. And these decisions can combine to produce surprisingly human-like behaviors.\n\nOver the next few chapters, we dive down through the top few layers of NLP. The top three layers are all that is required to perform meaningful sentiment analysis and semantic search and to build human-mimicking chatbots. In fact, it’s possible to build a useful and interesting chatbot using only a single layer of processing, using the text (character sequences) directly as the features for a language model. A chatbot that only does string matching and search is capable of participating in a reasonably convincing conversation if given enough example statements and responses.\n\nFor example, the open source project ChatterBot simplifies this pipeline by merely computing the string \"edit distance\" (Levenshtein distance) between an input statement and the statements recorded in its database. If its database of statement-response pairs contains a matching statement, the corresponding reply (from a previously \"learned\" human or machine dialog) can be reused as the reply to the latest user statement. For this pipeline, all that is required is step 3 (Generate) of our chatbot pipeline. And within this stage, only a brute-force search algorithm is required to find the best response. With this simple technique (no tokenization or feature generation required), ChatterBot can maintain a convincing conversion as the dialog engine for Salvius, a mechanical robot built from salvaged parts by Gunther Cox.\n[\n65\n]\nWill is an open source Python chatbot framework by Steven Skoczen with a completely different approach.\n[\n66\n]\nWill can only be trained to respond to statements by programming it with regular expressions. This is the labor-intensive and data-light approach to NLP. This grammar-based approach is especially effective for question-answering systems and task-execution assistant bots, like Lex, Siri, and Google Now. These kinds of systems overcome the \"brittleness\" of regular expressions by employing \"fuzzy regular expressions.\"footnote:[The Python regex package is backward compatible with re and adds fuzziness among other features. The regex will replace the re package in future Python versions\n(\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex\n).\nSimilarly TRE agrep, or \"approximate grep,\" (\nhttps://github.com/laurikari/tre\n)\nis an alternative to the UNIX command-line application grep.] and other techniques for finding approximate grammar matches. Fuzzy regular expressions find the closest grammar matches among a list of possible grammar rules (regular expressions) instead of exact matches by ignoring social media. If you need it to respond in real-time, without continuous monitoring by humans, you will need to think about ways to prevent it from saying things that harm your business, your reputation, or your users. You’ll need to do more than simply connect your users directly to the LLM.",
        "### Continuous Bag-of-Word\nAfter the training is complete the output layer of the network is discarded. Only the weights of the inputs to the hidden layer are important. They represent the semantic meaning of words.\nSimilar words are found in similar contexts …\n… their weights to the hidden layer adjust in similar ways\n… this result in similar vector representations\n\nSKIP-GRAM VS. CBOW: WHEN TO USE WHICH APPROACH\nMikolov highlighted that the skip-gram approach works well with small corpora and rare terms. With the skip-gram approach, you’ll have more examples due to the network structure. But the continuous bag-of-words approach shows higher accuracies for frequent words and is much faster to train.\n\nContinuous bag of words vs. bag of words\nIn previous chapters, we introduced the concept of a bag of words, but how is it different than a continuous bag of words? To establish the relationships between words in a sentence you slide a rolling window across the sentence to select the surround-ing words for the target word. All words within the sliding window are considered to be the content of the continuous bag of words for the target word at the middle of that window.\n\nExample for a continuous bag of words passing a rolling window of five words over the sentence “Claude Monet painted the Grand Canal of Venice in 1908.” The word painted is the target or center word within a five-word rolling window. “Claude,” “Monet,” “the,” and “Grand” are the four surrounding words for the first CBOW rolling window.\n\nthe highest probability will be converted to 1, and all remaining terms will be set to 0.\nThis simplifies the loss calculation.\n After training of the neural network is completed, you’ll notice that the weights have been trained to represent the semantic meaning. Thanks to the one-hot vector conversion of your tokens, each row in the weight matrix represents each word from the vocabulary for your corpus. After the training, semantically similar words will have similar vectors, because they were trained to predict similar surrounding words. This is purely magical!\n After the training is complete and you decide not to train your word model any further, the output layer of the network can be ignored. Only the weights of the inputs to the hidden layer are used as the embeddings. Or in other words: the weight matrix is your word embedding. The dot product between the one-hot vector representing the input term and the weights then represents the word vector embedding.\n\nRetrieving word vectors with linear algebra\nThe weights of a hidden layer in a neural network are often represented as a matrix: one column per input neuron, one row per output neuron. This allows the weight matrix to be multiplied by the column vector of inputs coming from the previous layer to generate a column vector of outputs going to the next layer . So if you multiply (dot product) a one-hot row vector by the trained weight matrix, you’ll get a vector that is one weight from each neuron (from each matrix column). This also works if you take the weight matrix and multiply it (dot product) by a one-hot column vector for the word you are interested in.\n\nOf course, the one-hot vector dot product just selects that row from your weight matrix that contains the weights for that word, which is your word vector. So you could easily retrieve that row by just selecting it, using the word’s row number or index num-ber from your vocabulary.\n\nWE of Monet\n\nThe weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer are the word embeddings. These weights are adjusted during training to minimize the prediction error.  Words appearing in similar contexts will have their weights adjusted in similar ways, resulting in similar vector representations. The output layer is discarded after training."

The chatbot's knowledge domain extends beyond the specific topics covered in class to include general course information. Examples include identifying course teachers, recommending textbooks, and providing other relevant details regarding the course structure and administration.\n\nA critical requirement is that the chatbot must **exclusively** address questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM course. It must accurately identify and reject out-of-context queries, responding appropriately that it is not authorized to provide information outside the designated scope. This capability ensures that the chatbot remains a focused and reliable resource for course-related inquiries.\n\nProject deliverables include:\n\n*   **Chatbot Code:** The complete source code of the implemented chatbot.\n*   **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the chatbot solution. The report should offer a detailed explanation of the chosen architecture, algorithms, and any specific techniques used to achieve the project goals.\n\n`",

Does the response directly address the question and provide the needed information?\n*   **Fluency:** This metric assesses the readability and grammatical correctness of the chatbot's output. The generated text should be natural, well-structured, and free of grammatical errors.\n*   **Coherence:** This evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the chatbot's responses. The text should be internally consistent, and the sequence of statements should form a coherent whole.\n\n**Phase 2: Robustness and Precision Assessment**\n\nThe second evaluation phase aims to test the chatbot's ability to handle challenging or ambiguous inputs and maintain accuracy:\n\n*   **Robustness:** This criterion assesses the chatbot's resilience to adversarial or misleading prompts. It tests the chatbot's ability to avoid being misled by prompts designed to trick or confuse it (e.g., questions containing statements like \"Are you sure?\"). The chatbot should maintain accuracy and avoid generating inappropriate responses, even when confronted with manipulative prompts.\n*   **Precision:** This evaluates the chatbot's ability to distinguish between in-context and out-of-context questions. Can the chatbot accurately identify and reject questions unrelated to the NLP and LLM course (e.g., \"Who is the king of Spain?\")?\n\nBased on the chatbot's performance across these aspects, the course instructors will assign a grade that reflects its overall quality and effectiveness. The grade will be determined holistically, considering the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in each evaluation category.",
        "**Contextual Enrichment: The Role of Chatbot Frameworks and LLMs**\n\nThe exercise of creating a pizzeria chatbot highlights practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of chatbot frameworks. Building functional and engaging chatbots requires careful consideration of several factors, including the user's intent, the bot's responses, and the overall conversational flow.\n\nChatbot frameworks are designed to abstract away many of the complexities involved in creating a dialog engine, allowing developers to focus on designing the bot's behavior in a domain-specific language.\n\nAs the included context emphasizes, teachers inspire students using feedback on how well the student understands the material. They also think up new ideas as students pose interesting new questions. Students' needs are diverse and dynamic. Due to this fact, hybrid chatbots integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a better method for creating production chatbots in all domains. LLMs are proficient and convincing in their ability to converse with users on virtually any topic. However, the key is to control this power intelligently to prevent misleading or harmful interactions.",
        "1.11 Natural language IQ\nLike human brainpower, the power of an NLP pipeline cannot be easily\ngauged with a single IQ score without considering multiple \"smarts\"\ndimensions.

        "`\n\n**Chatbot Evaluation Procedure (In-Depth):**\n\nThe evaluation of the chatbots will consist of two phases, both conducted in real-time during the project discussion. The course instructors will directly interact with each group's chatbot by posing a set of predefined questions.\n\n**Phase 1: Core Performance Evaluation**\n\nThe initial evaluation will assess the chatbot's core capabilities using the following metrics:\n\n*   **Relevance:** This criterion evaluates whether the chatbot's generated text effectively answers the user's query. Does the response directly address the question and provide the needed information?\n*   **Fluency:** This metric assesses the readability and grammatical correctness of the chatbot's output. The generated text should be natural, well-structured, and free of grammatical errors.\n*   **Coherence:** This evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the chatbot's responses. The text should be internally consistent, and the sequence of statements should form a coherent whole.\n\n**Phase 2: Robustness and Precision Assessment**\n\nThe second evaluation phase aims to test the chatbot's ability to handle challenging or ambiguous inputs and maintain accuracy:\n\n*   **Robustness:** This criterion assesses the chatbot's resilience to adversarial or misleading prompts. It tests the chatbot's ability to avoid being misled by prompts designed to trick or confuse it (e.g., questions containing statements like \"Are you sure?\"). The chatbot should maintain accuracy and avoid generating inappropriate responses, even when confronted with manipulative prompts.\n*   **Precision:** This evaluates the chatbot's ability to distinguish between in-context and out-of-context questions. Can the chatbot accurately identify and reject questions unrelated to the NLP and LLM course (e.g., \"Who is the king of Spain?\")?\n\nBased on the chatbot's performance across these aspects, the course instructors will assign a grade that reflects its overall quality and effectiveness. The grade will be determined holistically, considering the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in each evaluation category.",
        "`\n\n**Goal of the Project (Detailed):**\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a chatbot proficient in answering questions related to the NLP and LLM course content for the 2024/2025 academic year. The chatbot's knowledge domain extends beyond the specific topics covered in class to include general course information. Examples include identifying course teachers, recommending textbooks, and providing other relevant details regarding the course structure and administration.\n\nA critical requirement is that the chatbot must **exclusively** address questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM course. It must accurately identify and reject out-of-context queries, responding appropriately that it is not authorized to provide information outside the designated scope. This capability ensures that the chatbot remains a focused and reliable resource for course-related inquiries.\n\nProject deliverables include:\n\n*   **Chatbot Code:** The complete source code of the implemented chatbot.\n*   **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the chatbot solution. The report should offer a detailed explanation of the chosen architecture, algorithms, and any specific techniques used to achieve the project goals.\n\n`",

        "12.5 Chatbot frameworks\nIn each of the previous chapters, you’ve learned a new technique for\nprocessing text to understand what the user is saying. And in this chapter,\nyou’ve learned four approaches to generating text for a chatbot to use in its\nresponse to the user. You’ve already assembled a few chatbots from these\nNLU and NLG algorithms to understand the advantages and disadvantages of\neach of these algorithms. Now you have the knowledge you need to use a\nchatbot framework\n smartly. A chatbot framework is an application and a\nsoftware library that abstracts away some of these detailed decisions you\nneed to make when building a dialog engine for your chatbot. A framework\ngives you a way to specify your chatbot’s behavior in \ndomain-specific\nlanguage\n that it can later interpret and \nrun\n so that your chatbot replies the\nway you intended.\nMost chatbot frameworks use a declarative programming language to specify\na bot’s behavior and some even give you a graphical user interface to\nprogram your bot. There are no-code chatbot frameworks that abstract the\ndeclarative chatbot programming language with an interactive graphical\nrepresentation of the dialog graph or flow diagram that you can modify with\nyour mouse. These no-code frameworks usually include a dialog engine that\ncan execute your chatbot without you ever having to see or edit the\nunderlying data. In the impact world, an open source platform sponsored by\nUNICEF, RapidPro,\n[\n34\n]\n served as a core for several chatbot platforms, such as\nWeni, Textit and Glific, that are all used for impact purposes. In RapidPro,\nyou can build your dialogs in a graphical user interface. You can also easily\nimport and export the content using open standard file formats which is\nhelpful when you want to translate the content from one natural language to\nanother for a multilingual chatbot. ManyChat and Landbot are two closed\nsource no-code chatbot builders that have similar functionality.\nBut if you’ve read this far, you probably have ideas for more sophisticated\nchatbots than what’s possible in a no-code platform. So you will probably\nneed a chatbot programming language to make your vision a reality. Of\ncourse, you can specify your bot \"stack\" in Python by directly employing the\nskills you learned in this book. But if you want to build a scalable and\nmaintainable chatbot you’ll need a chatbot framework that uses a chatbot\ndesign language or data structure that you understand. You want a language\nthat makes sense to you so that you can quickly get the conversation design\nyou have in your head embedded in a working chatbot. In this section, you\nwill learn of several different frameworks that can help you make your\nchatbot dreams come true.\nUsing the tools described here, you can build a bot that can serve you (and\nmaybe a few friends, or even more people if you’re lucky) if deployed on a\nserver or in a cloud. However, if you want to build a chatbot that servers\nhundreds or thousands of users, you need a more robust, scalable system.\nLuckily, there are frameworks available that allow you to focus on building\nyour bot while taking care of the challenges that come with the need to build\na production-grade system. We will now discuss three popular open-source\nPython chatbot frameworks for building chatbots with configurable NLP\ncapabilities: Rasa, LangChain, and qary.",
        "1.11 Natural language IQ\nLike human brainpower, the power of an NLP pipeline cannot be easily\ngauged with a single IQ score without considering multiple \"smarts\"\ndimensions. A common way to measure the capability of a robotic system is\nalong the dimensions of behavior complexity and the degree of human\nsupervision required. But for a natural language processing pipeline, the goal\nis to build systems that fully automate the processing of natural language,\neliminating all human supervision (once the model is trained and deployed).\nSo a better pair of IQ dimensions should capture the breadth and depth of the\ncomplexity of the natural language pipeline.\nA consumer product chatbot or virtual assistant like Alexa or Allo is usually\ndesigned to have extremely broad knowledge and capabilities. However, the\nlogic used to respond to requests tends to be shallow, often consisting of a set\nof trigger phrases that all produce the same response with a single if-then\ndecision branch. Alexa (and the underlying Lex engine) behave like a single\nlayer, flat tree of (if, elif, elif, …) statements.\n[\n68\n]\n Google Dialogflow (which\nwas developed independently of Google’s Allo and Google Assistant) has\nsimilar capabilities to Amazon Lex, Contact Flow, and Lambda, but without\nthe drag-and-drop user interface for designing your dialog tree.\nOn the other hand, the Google Translate pipeline (or any similar machine\ntranslation system) relies on a deep tree of feature extractors, decision trees,\nand knowledge graphs connecting bits of knowledge about the world.\nSometimes these feature extractors, decision trees, and knowledge graphs are\nexplicitly programmed into the system, as in Figure 1.5.

        "## BERT\n*   BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a language model introduced by Google Research in 2018 for language understanding. The acronym emphasizes its key characteristic: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.\n*   BERT leverages only the encoder part of the Transformer model. Two main versions exist: BERT-base, which comprises 12 stacked encoder blocks and 110 million parameters, and BERT-large, featuring 24 stacked encoder blocks and 340 million parameters. The increased number of layers and parameters in BERT-large allows it to capture more complex linguistic patterns.\n*   BERT is pre-trained to use \"bidirectional\" context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words when understanding a word in a sentence. This contrasts with unidirectional models that only consider the context up to the current word.\n*   BERT is specifically designed to serve as a pre-trained base for various Natural Language Processing tasks. After pre-training, it is fine-tuned on specific datasets tailored to the downstream task, adapting its general language understanding capabilities to the nuances of the task at hand.\n\nThis section provides a high-level overview of BERT, emphasizing its bidirectional context and its role as a pre-trained model."

    "final_response": "<div>\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing, and BERT, with its unique architecture and fine-tuning capabilities, has revolutionized the way NER is performed.\n\nAt a high level, BERT's approach to NER involves leveraging its bidirectional contextual understanding and fine-tuning process. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Input Representation:</strong> BERT accepts a sequence of tokens as input. Each token is represented as a sum of its token embedding, segment embedding (to differentiate between two sentences in tasks like question answering), and position embedding (to capture token order). This input representation allows BERT to understand the context of each token in a sentence.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bidirectional Encoder:</strong> Unlike traditional language models that process text sequentially, BERT uses a Transformer encoder to process the entire sentence at once. This allows it to capture bidirectional context, meaning it considers both left and right contexts of a word when creating its representation. This is particularly useful for NER as it helps disambiguate words with multiple possible entity types based on their surrounding context.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fine-Tuning:</strong> BERT is typically pre-trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuned on specific NER datasets. During fine-tuning, the model learns to predict the correct entity type for each token. The pre-training process provides BERT with a rich understanding of language, while fine-tuning adapts this knowledge to the specific task of NER. This transfer learning approach is one of BERT's key strengths.</li>\n    <li><strong>Output and Prediction:</strong> For NER, BERT outputs a vector of probabilities for each token, indicating the likelihood of it belonging to a particular entity type (e.g., person, organization, location). These probabilities are then passed through an argmax function to obtain the predicted entity type for each token. This process is repeated for each sentence in the input data.</li>\n</ol>\n\nBy following these steps, BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various NER tasks. Its ability to capture bidirectional context and adapt to specific datasets through fine-tuning makes it a powerful tool for recognizing and classifying named entities in text.\n</div>",

        "## BERT Strengths and Limitations\n*   **Strengths**\n    *   **Bidirectional Contextual Understanding**: BERT provides richer and more accurate representations of language by considering both preceding and succeeding words.\n    *   **Flexibility in Transfer Learning**: BERT’s pretraining allows for easy adaptation to diverse NLP tasks through fine-tuning.\n    *   **High Performance on Benchmark Datasets**: BERT consistently ranks at or near the top on benchmark datasets like SQuAD (Question Answering) and GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation).\n*   **Limitations**\n    *   **Large Model Size**: High computational and memory requirements can make deployment challenging, especially on resource-constrained devices.\n    *   **Pretraining Costs**: Requires extensive computational resources, especially for BERT-Large, making pretraining from scratch impractical for most researchers.\n    *   **Fine-Tuning Time and Data**: Fine-tuning on new tasks still requires labeled data and can be time-intensive, particularly for complex tasks or large datasets.\n\nThis section outlines the strengths and limitations of BERT, providing a balanced perspective on its capabilities.",
        "## BERT\n*   BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a language model introduced by Google Research in 2018 for language understanding. The acronym emphasizes its key characteristic: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.\n*   BERT leverages only the encoder part of the Transformer model. Two main versions exist: BERT-base, which comprises 12 stacked encoder blocks and 110 million parameters, and BERT-large, featuring 24 stacked encoder blocks and 340 million parameters. The increased number of layers and parameters in BERT-large allows it to capture more complex linguistic patterns.\n*   BERT is pre-trained to use \"bidirectional\" context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words when understanding a word in a sentence. This contrasts with unidirectional models that only consider the context up to the current word.\n*   BERT is specifically designed to serve as a pre-trained base for various Natural Language Processing tasks. After pre-training, it is fine-tuned on specific datasets tailored to the downstream task, adapting its general language understanding capabilities to the nuances of the task at hand.\n\nThis section provides a high-level overview of BERT, emphasizing its bidirectional context and its role as a pre-trained model."

The lesson is instructed by Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco.\n\n**Exercise: Developing a Pizzeria Chatbot**\n\nThe primary task is to create a chatbot designed to streamline and enhance the operations of a pizzeria. The chatbot will enable users to interact with the pizzeria through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the following functionalities:\n\n*   **Menu Requests:** Users can ask the chatbot to provide the pizzeria's menu.\n*   **Pizza Orders:** Users can order a pizza, but only one pizza per order is permitted. Beverage ordering is excluded in this simplified version.\n*   **Order Logging:** After an order is confirmed, the chatbot must log essential details including the date of the order, the user's identification (user ID), and the specific type of pizza ordered. This logging function should be implemented using a custom action to provide flexibility and extensibility.\n*   **Web-Based GUI:** The chatbot must be accessible through a web-based GUI for ease of use and broad accessibility.\n\nIt's recommended to begin with a basic \"dummy bot\" to establish the foundational structure, then add functionality incrementally.\n\n**Example Conversation:**\n\nThe following is a sample dialogue demonstrating the expected interaction flow between a user and the chatbot:\n\nUser: Can I have the menu?\n\nBot: What kind of pizza would you like? We have Parenti, Pepperoni, Vegetarian...\n\nUser: Pepperoni\n\nBot: You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\n\nUser: Yes\n\nBot: Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!",

        "**Hints and Implementation Details**\n\nTo initiate the project, create the necessary directory and initialize a Rasa project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir pizzaBot\ncd pizzaBot\nrasa init --no-prompt\n```\n\nThis series of commands first creates a directory named `pizzaBot`, then navigates into it. Inside this directory, `rasa init --no-prompt` initializes a new Rasa project without prompting for user input. This is a quick way to set up the basic project structure. Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework, which is helpful when building a chatbot with configurable NLP capabilities.\n\nNext, configure and run the REST and Actions servers:\n\n```bash\nrasa run --cors \"*\"\nrasa run actions\n```\n\nThe first command, `rasa run --cors \"*\"`, starts the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for all origins. This setting is mainly for development purposes to allow web frontends hosted on different domains to communicate with the Rasa server. The second command, `rasa run actions`, launches the actions server. This server executes custom Python code (actions) which are used to extend the bot's functionality, such as logging the order details in this scenario.\n\nTo create the web frontend of this project, consider using a web widget such as the one available at:\n\n[https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0)\n\nThis widget provides a ready-made interface that can be integrated with the Rasa chatbot."

        "12.1 Chatbots are everywhere\nChatbots are everywhere. Here are some examples to help you dream up your\nown projects.\nVirtual assistants\n: Dicio (Google Assistant), Lyra (Siri) and MyCroft\n(Alexa) can help you accomplish small tasks such as checking the\nweather, calling a friend, launching an app, setting a reminder, playing\nmusic, or turning on the lights.\nEntertainment\n: Chatbots in video games and websites promoting movies\nare often used to keep you engaged in a fictional storyline. You can\nmeasure how well an entertainment chatbot is doing by how long the\nuser is willing to interact with the chatbot and how often they suspend\ntheir disbelief that they are interacting with a human.\nHealthcare\n: Depending on the regulations in your country, chatbots can\noften answer your health-related questions, schedule an appointment for\nyou, or even give a preliminary diagnosis. Mental health chatbots, such\nas Woebot \n[\n4\n]\n and Wysa,\n[\n5\n]\n even provide therapeutic exercises that can\ndecrease depression and anxiety.\n[\n6\n]\nImpact\n: Nonprofits and social businesses use chatbots to help people in\nneed. Often they leverage popular messaging channels like SMS and\nWhatsApp to reach people in underserved communities where mobile\nmessaging is their main access to the Internet.\nOperations (ChatOps)\n: Businesses often use chatbots to increase team\nproductivity and job satisfaction. You can build chatbots that interact\nwith you on Telegram or WhatsApp to help you monitor and control\nyour software. And, if you’re lucky, your boss at work might use a\nchatbot to onboard and train you, or even publicly recognize you when\nyou help a teammate learn something new.\nAdvertisement and Sales\n: Search engines on corporate websites often\nuse chatbots to steer you towards advertisements and products they want\nyou to purchase or promote. Behind the scenes these bots are often used\nto distract and \nengage\n you on (anti)social networks.\nCustomer (dis)service\n: Machines have been replacing humans at\ncustomer service call centers and chat message interfaces for decades.\nMost large corporations do not allow you to interact with a human until\nyou first satisfy their chatbot gatekeepers.\nThe authors of this book founded Tangible AI to help nonprofits,\ngovernments, and individual makers create impact chatbots.\n[\n7\n]\n Impact\nchatbots help people in underserved communities, from new immigrants in\nthe United States to teens in the Global South. We’ve built chatbots that help\npeople learn math, overcome imposter syndrome, learn new languages, evade\nhuman traffickers, and even start a small business in a developing country. A\ncontributing author and Tangible AI volunteer, Vishvesh Bhat, has even\nfounded a startup of his own to build a chatbot that helps US college students\nlearn and reason about their course material.\n[\n8\n]\nNext, you will learn how to build your own chatbots to bring a positive\nimpact to your community or business.\n[\n9\n]\n \n[\n10\n]"

    "final_response": "<div>\n<p>The context processing approach differs significantly between Encoder-only and Decoder-only models. Encoder-only models, such as BERT, employ bidirectional attention, allowing them to process the entire input sequence in parallel. This means that each token in the sequence attends to all other tokens, enabling the model to capture contextual relationships between words regardless of their position. This parallel processing capability enables Encoder-only models to excel at tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering, where understanding the full context simultaneously is crucial.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Decoder-only models, including GPT and LLAMA, utilize causal (unidirectional) attention and sequential context buildup. They process tokens one by one, attending only to previous tokens in the sequence. This sequential processing enables the model to build context iteratively, generating the next token based on the accumulated understanding from the preceding tokens. Decoder-only models are highly effective for language generation tasks, such as text generation, summarization, and question answering, as they can generate coherent and contextually relevant output by focusing on past tokens.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Encoder-only models process context in parallel, capturing bidirectional relationships, while Decoder-only models build context sequentially, attending only to past tokens. These distinct approaches make them suitable for different tasks, with Encoder-only models shining in understanding-focused tasks and Decoder-only models excelling in language generation and autoregressive prediction.</p>\n</div>",
