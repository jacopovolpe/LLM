NLP is a field of computer science focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.\n*   **Natural Language Understanding and Generation:**  Students will learn about the two primary branches of NLP: Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which focuses on enabling machines to comprehend the meaning of text, and Natural Language Generation (NLG), which deals with creating human-readable text from structured data or internal representations. NLU involves tasks such as semantic search, text alignment, paraphrase recognition, intent classification, and authorship attribution. NLG involves tasks such as synonym substitution, question answering, spelling and grammar correction, and casual conversation.\n*   **Statistical Approaches to NLP:** The course will cover traditional statistical methods used in NLP, such as n-grams, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).  These techniques rely on analyzing large amounts of text data to identify patterns and relationships between words and phrases.\n*   **Large Language Models (LLM) based on Transformers:** A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to LLMs, particularly those based on the Transformer architecture.  Transformers have revolutionized NLP due to their ability to process sequential data in parallel and capture long-range dependencies in text. Key components like self-attention, multi-head attention, and positional encoding will be explored.\n*   **NLP Applications with LLM:** Students will explore various real-world applications of NLP powered by LLMs.  These applications include machine translation, text summarization, question answering, chatbot development, sentiment analysis, and content generation.\n*   **Prompt Engineering and Fine Tuning of LLM:**  The course will provide training on how to effectively interact with LLMs through prompt engineering and how to customize pre-trained models for specific tasks via fine-tuning. Prompt engineering involves designing effective input prompts to elicit desired responses from LLMs. Fine-tuning involves further training a pre-trained LLM on a smaller, task-specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular application.\n\n**Abilities:**\n\n*   **Design and Implementation of a NLP System based on LLMs:** Students will gain the practical skills necessary to design and build complete NLP systems using LLMs. This includes integrating existing technologies and tools from libraries like Hugging Face, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to create solutions for real-world problems.",

This process was often labor-intensive and required deep domain expertise.\n*   **Model Selection:** Involved choosing the most appropriate model for a given task from a range of available models. The selection was crucial as each model had its strengths and weaknesses depending on the data and the task.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** Used to transfer knowledge from one domain to another, particularly when labeled data was scarce. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity to prevent overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data) while maintaining good generalization performance was a critical challenge.

This pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on specific tasks, leveraging the knowledge gained during pre-training.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs can perform tasks without any task-specific training data (zero-shot) or with very limited examples (few-shot). This capability significantly reduces the need for large labeled datasets.\n*   **Prompting:** Models can understand and perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. This approach eliminates the need for extensive task-specific training, making models more versatile and accessible.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** There's a growing emphasis on understanding the inner workings of LLMs to explain their decisions and behaviors.

This template instructs the LLM to extract the name of the winning team from the input text and format the output as JSON.\n2.  **Create Follow-up PromptTemplate:** Creates a `PromptTemplate` object for the follow-up prompt, specifying the template string and the input variable (`text`).\n3.  **Define Follow-up Chain:** Creates a chain consisting of the `followup_prompt_template` and the `llm`.\n4.  **Invoke Follow-up Chain:** Calls the `invoke` method on the `followup_chain` object, providing a dictionary with the value for the `text` variable (which is the initial LLM response). This executes the follow-up chain and returns the refined LLM response.\n5.  **Print Refined Output:** Prints the refined LLM response, which is the name of the winning team in JSON format.\n\n**Example Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"winner\": \"Croatia\"}\n```",

            "**Querying an LLM Model**\n\nThis section demonstrates how to query a Large Language Model (LLM) using LangChain and Hugging Face. The example uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model to answer a question about the FIFA World Cup.\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"] = \"YOUR_API_TOKEN\"\n\nllm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(\n    repo_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\",\n    temperature = 0.1\n)\n\nquery = \"Who won the FIFA World Cup in the year 2006?\"\nprint(llm.invoke(query))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Import Libraries:** Import necessary modules from `langchain_huggingface` and the `os` module for environment variables.\n2.  **Set API Token:** Sets the Hugging Face API token as an environment variable. Replace `\"YOUR_API_TOKEN\"` with your actual API token. Storing the API key as an environment variable is a more secure and flexible practice than hardcoding it directly into the script.\n3.  **Initialize LLM:** Creates an instance of `HuggingFaceEndpoint`, specifying the `repo_id` (the model to use) and `temperature` (controls the randomness of the output). A lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) results in more deterministic and predictable responses.\n4.  **Define Query:** Defines the question to be asked to the LLM.\n5.  **Invoke LLM:** Calls the `invoke` method on the `llm` object with the query. This sends the query to the LLM and retrieves the response.\n6.  **Print Response:** Prints the response from the LLM.\n\n**Example Response:**\n\n```\nThe FIFA World Cup in the year 2006 was won by the Italian national football team. They defeated France in the final match held on July 9, 2006, at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. The Italian team was coached by Marcello Lippi and was led by the legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. The team's victory was significant as they had not won the World Cup since 1982. The final match ended in a 1-1 draw after extra time, and the Italians won the penalty shootout 5-3. The winning goal in the shootout was scored by Andrea Pirlo.\n```\n\n**Security Note:**\n\nThe example highlights the importance of storing the Hugging Face API token in an environment variable for security reasons. This prevents the token from being exposed in the code.\n\n*   **macOS or Linux:**\n\n    ```bash\n    export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=\"api_token\"\n    ```\n*   **Windows with PowerShell:**\n\n    ```powershell\n    setx HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN \"api_token\"\n    ```",

The course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of NLP fundamentals and equip them with the skills to design and implement LLM-based systems.",
            "## Outline\n\nThis lesson will cover the following key areas:\n\n*   **What is Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Introduction to the field, its core concepts, and importance.\n*   **Applications of NLP:** A survey of diverse applications across various industries and domains.\n*   **History of NLP:** Tracing the evolution of NLP from its early stages to the current state-of-the-art.",
            "**Paradigm Shift in NLP**\n\nThe advent of LLMs has brought about a significant paradigm shift in NLP, changing the way we approach various tasks and challenges.\n\n**Before LLMs:**\n\n*   **Feature Engineering:** Focused on manually designing or selecting the best features for a specific task. This process was often labor-intensive and required deep domain expertise.\n*   **Model Selection:** Involved choosing the most appropriate model for a given task from a range of available models. The selection was crucial as each model had its strengths and weaknesses depending on the data and the task.\n*   **Transfer Learning:** Used to transfer knowledge from one domain to another, particularly when labeled data was scarce. Models pre-trained on large datasets were fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets.\n*   **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Balancing model complexity to prevent overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data) while maintaining good generalization performance was a critical challenge. Techniques like regularization and cross-validation were commonly used.\n\n**Since LLMs:**\n\n*   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, capturing general language patterns and knowledge. This pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on specific tasks, leveraging the knowledge gained during pre-training.\n*   **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs can perform tasks without any task-specific training data (zero-shot) or with very limited examples (few-shot). This capability significantly reduces the need for large labeled datasets.\n*   **Prompting:** Models can understand and perform tasks simply by describing them in natural language prompts. This approach eliminates the need for extensive task-specific training, making models more versatile and accessible.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** There's a growing emphasis on understanding the inner workings of LLMs to explain their decisions and behaviors. This is crucial for ensuring trust and reliability in critical applications.\n\nThe paradigm shift was largely driven by the limitations of recurrent networks (RNNs), which struggled with long sequences due to information loss during encoding. Additionally, the sequential nature of RNNs hindered parallel training, favoring inputs from later timesteps.\n\nThe solution: **Attention Mechanism**.\n\nThe attention mechanism addresses these limitations by:\n*   Handling long-range dependencies effectively.\n*   Enabling parallel training.\n*   Assigning dynamic attention weights based on input relevance."

            "**LLM Fine Tuning**\n\n*   **Feature-Based Fine Tuning:** Extracting features from the pre-trained LLM and training a separate model on those features for a specific task.\n*   **Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning and Low Rank Adaptation:**  Techniques for fine-tuning LLMs with a limited number of trainable parameters, reducing the computational cost and memory requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) falls into this category, decomposing weight updates and significantly reducing the number of parameters.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback:** Training LLMs using reinforcement learning, where the reward signal is based on human feedback. This allows the model to learn from human preferences and improve its ability to generate high-quality, human-aligned text.",
            "**Fine-tuning with Custom Data:**\n\nFine-tuning involves training the LLM on specific, curated datasets that are aligned with the desired guidelines. By adjusting the model's weights during this process, developers can influence the LLM to produce outputs that are more consistent with ethical and operational standards.\n\nExamples:\n*   Fine-tune for medical advice to restrict responses to accurate and safe recommendations.\n*   Fine-tune for question answering on the topics of the course.\n\nFine-tuning is a more sophisticated technique than rule-based filters, as it involves modifying the LLM's underlying behavior. This can be particularly effective for ensuring that the LLM provides accurate and reliable information in specific domains. Also, it may help to make the system provide high reliability for use cases such as preventing providing legal or medical advice.",
            "**Using LLMs after pre-training**\n\nAfter pre-training, LLMs can be adapted for specific tasks using two primary methods: fine-tuning and prompting.\n\n*   **Fine-tuning:** Gradient descent on weights to optimize performance on one task. Fine-tuning involves updating the model's parameters using labeled data specific to the task.\n    *   What to fine-tune? Options include:\n        *   Full network: Updating all the model's parameters.\n        *   Readout heads: Only updating the classification layers.\n        *   Adapters: Adding small, task-specific modules.\n    *   Changes the model \"itself,\" adapting it to the task.\n*   **Prompting:** Design special prompts to cue / condition the network into specific mode to solve any tasks. Prompting involves providing the model with specific instructions or context to guide its behavior.\n    *   No parameter change. The model's parameters remain fixed.\n    *   One model to rule them all. A single pre-trained model can be used for multiple tasks.\n    *   Changes the way to use it. The model's behavior is controlled by the prompt.",
