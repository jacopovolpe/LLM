 Edition!
This book is a practical guide to building and deploying natural language
processing (NLP) applications. It covers a wide range of topics, from the basics
of text processing and word embeddings to advanced techniques like
transformers and large language models.
The book is divided into 15 chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of NLP.
Here's a brief overview of what you'll learn:
1. Machines that read and write (NLP overview)
2. Tokens of thought (natural language words)
3. Math with words (TF-IDF vectors)
4. Finding meaning in word counts (semantic analysis)
5. Word brain (neural networks)
6. Reasoning with word embeddings (word vectors)
7. Finding Kernels of Knowledge in Text with Convolutional Neural Networks
8. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle Your Words (RNNs and LSTMs)
9. Stackable deep learning (Transformers)
10. Large Language Models in the real world
11. Information extraction and knowledge graphs (grounding)
12. Getting Chatty with Dialog Engines
13. Appendix A. Your NLP tools
14. Appendix B. Playful Python and regular expressions
15. Appendix C. Vectors and Linear Algebra
16. Appendix D. Machine learning tools and techniques
17. Appendix E. Deploy NLU containerized microservices
18. Appendix F. Glossary
In this first chapter, we'll introduce the basics of NLP and discuss some of the
key challenges in building NLP applications. We'll also take a look at some
common NLP tasks and the tools you'll need to get started.
By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of what NLP is,
why it's important, and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. You'll
also be ready to dive into the more advanced topics covered in the rest of the
book.
So let's get started!

In this lesson, we will discuss the Encoder-Decoder Transformers, specifically
the T5 model, and its applications in translation and summarization tasks.
Encoder-Decoder Transformers are a class of neural networks
