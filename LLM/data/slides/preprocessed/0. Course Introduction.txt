
In this book, you will learn how to build a complete NLP pipeline from
scratch, starting with the basics of tokenizing text and moving on to
building sophisticated neural networks for NLU and NLG. You will
learn how to use Python to build your NLP pipeline, and you will learn
how to use the latest NLP libraries and tools to make your life easier.
