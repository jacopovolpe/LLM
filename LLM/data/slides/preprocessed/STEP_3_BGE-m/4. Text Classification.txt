**DIEM – University of Salerno**

This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of text classification, focusing on its application in various NLP tasks. We will explore the different types of classification, the machine learning pipeline for building a text classifier, and delve into specific examples using the Reuters and IMDB datasets.  We'll also discuss evaluation metrics for assessing classifier performance.

* Topic Labelling Example:  Practical application of text classification using the Reuters news dataset.
* Sentiment Analysis Exercise: Building a sentiment classifier with the IMDB movie review dataset.

**Text Classification**

Text classification assigns predefined categories to text documents based solely on their content, disregarding metadata. This differs from *document classification*, which considers metadata, and *document clustering*, which discovers categories from unlabeled data.  Text classification is crucial for various applications, including spam detection, sentiment analysis, topic categorization, and intent recognition in conversational AI.


<----------section---------->

**Definition**

Formally, given a set of documents *D* = {d₁, …, dₙ} and a set of predefined classes *C* = {c₁, …, cₘ}, text classification seeks a classifier function:

*F*: *D* x *C* → {True, False}

This function *F* determines whether a document dᵢ belongs to class cⱼ, assigning a Boolean value accordingly.

**Types of Classification**

* **Single-label:** Each document is assigned to exactly one class. This is appropriate when categories are mutually exclusive.
* **Binary:** A special case of single-label classification with only two classes (e.g., spam/not spam).  It simplifies the problem to a yes/no decision regarding a single category.
* **Multi-label:**  A document can belong to multiple classes simultaneously (e.g., a news article categorized as both "finance" and "politics").  This type acknowledges that documents can address multiple topics or themes.


<----------section---------->

**ML-Based Classification**

Machine learning (ML) is commonly employed for text classification.  A model learns from a training set of annotated documents, where each document is associated with its correct class labels. The process generally involves:

1. **Text Representation:** Converting text into a numerical vector format that ML algorithms can process. Common approaches include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which weighs words based on their importance within a document and across the corpus.
2. **Model Training:**  Using a labeled dataset to train an ML algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks) to learn the relationship between text features and class labels.
3. **Prediction:** Applying the trained model to classify new, unseen documents by predicting their likely categories. The model often provides a confidence score, indicating the certainty of the classification.

**Topic Labelling Example: Classifying Reuters News**

The Reuters 21578 dataset provides a real-world example of multi-class and multi-label text classification.  Containing news articles classified into 90 distinct categories, this dataset highlights the complexities of real-world text data.  Its characteristics include:

* **Multi-class:**  A wide range of categories representing different news topics.
* **Multi-label:**  Articles can belong to multiple categories.
* **Imbalanced Classes:** Uneven distribution of documents across categories, with some having significantly more examples than others. This poses a challenge for model training and requires careful consideration during evaluation.
* **Variable Document Length:**  The number of words per document varies, requiring appropriate handling during vectorization.

Further dataset statistics are available at https://martin-thoma.com/nlp-reuters/.  Working with this dataset provides valuable experience in addressing common challenges in text classification.

**Corpus Management (Code Example Included in Original Submission)**

This section outlines the practical steps for managing and processing the corpus for text classification:

1. **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transforming text documents into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, capturing the importance of words in each document and the corpus.
3. **Label Encoding:** Converting class labels into a numerical format suitable for ML algorithms. One-hot encoding is often used for multi-label classification, creating a binary vector for each class.
4. **Model Training:** Training a chosen ML classifier (e.g., Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) using the vectorized text and encoded labels.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained classifier's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics.

**Pre-Processing (Code Example Included in Original Submission)**

The `fit_transform` method efficiently combines the fitting and transforming steps in data pre-processing.

**MLP Classifier Training (Code Example and Graph Included in Original Submission)**

This section demonstrates the training process of an MLP classifier using the pre-processed data.

**Testing Metrics**

Evaluating classifier performance requires appropriate metrics.  For multi-class and multi-label problems, several averaging methods are used:

* **Micro Average:**  Calculates metrics globally by considering the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives across all classes. This approach is sensitive to class imbalance.
* **Macro Average:** Computes the metric for each class independently and then averages the results. This treats all classes equally, regardless of their size.
* **Weighted Average:**  Averages the metric for each class, weighted by the number of true instances (support) for each class. This balances the influence of different class sizes.
* **Samples Average:** Calculates metrics at the instance level, averaging the performance across individual samples. This is particularly relevant for multi-label classification where each instance can have multiple labels.

**Testing Results (Code Example and Output Included in Original Submission)**

This section presents the results of the classifier evaluation, including the chosen metrics.

**Sentiment Analysis Exercise**

Sentiment analysis, a specific application of text classification, aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in text (positive, negative, or neutral). Its applications are wide-ranging, including:

* **Business:** Understanding customer feedback and brand perception.
* **Finance:**  Gauging market sentiment and predicting stock movements.
* **Politics:** Analyzing public opinion and political discourse.

**IMDB Dataset**

The IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks.  Its balanced class distribution simplifies evaluation.  The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews.


<----------section---------->

**Exercise**

The exercise involves building a sentiment classifier using the IMDB dataset:

1. **Data Preparation:** Download and preprocess the IMDB dataset, splitting it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. **Label Encoding:** One-hot encode the sentiment labels (positive/negative) using `OneHotEncoder`.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Create TF-IDF vectors from the movie reviews, considering words appearing in at least 5 documents to reduce dimensionality and computational cost.
4. **Model Training:** Train a classifier (e.g., an MLP or another suitable algorithm) using the vectorized reviews and encoded labels.
5. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the classifier's performance on the test set using relevant metrics and visualize the results with a confusion matrix, plotted using a Seaborn heatmap. This helps visualize the model's performance in classifying positive and negative reviews.

**Suggestions**

Specific tools and techniques are suggested for the exercise:

* `OneHotEncoder` for label encoding.
* TF-IDF vectorization with a minimum document frequency of 5.
* `confusion_matrix` for generating the confusion matrix.
* Seaborn heatmaps for visualization (install with `pip install seaborn`; documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html).
