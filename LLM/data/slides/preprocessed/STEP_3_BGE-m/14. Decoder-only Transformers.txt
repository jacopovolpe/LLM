### Decoder-only Transformer

Decoder-only transformers, unlike the original transformer architecture which uses both encoder and decoder components, utilize only the decoder part. This architectural choice makes them particularly well-suited for autoregressive tasks, specifically text generation.  The absence of separate encoder layers simplifies the model and streamlines the process of generating text sequentially.  Tasks such as summarization and question answering, where the output is generated conditionally based on an input prompt, also benefit from this streamlined architecture.  Examples of successful decoder-only transformers include the GPT series and LLaMA.

The core principle behind text generation in decoder-only transformers is autoregression. This means generating text token by token, where each new token is predicted based on the preceding tokens in the sequence.  The input prompt and the generated text are treated as a single continuous sequence, enabling the model to implicitly "encode" the prompt's meaning while simultaneously "decoding" it into generated text. This unified approach eliminates the need for a separate encoder block.

The self-attention mechanism within decoder layers is crucial for context building.  However, a causal (unidirectional or forward) mask is applied to ensure that each token attends only to previous tokens, mimicking the natural flow of language generation.  This prevents the model from "looking ahead" at future tokens during training and generation.  This sequential processing allows the model to accumulate contextual information and learn complex relationships between tokens, effectively replacing the need for explicit encoder-decoder attention.

### Encoder-only vs. Decoder-only

| Feature          | Encoder-Only Transformers (e.g., BERT)                       | Decoder-Only Transformers (e.g., GPT)                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Architecture     | Only encoder blocks. Employs bidirectional self-attention, processing the entire input sequence simultaneously to capture context from both directions.                 | Only decoder blocks. Employs causal (unidirectional) self-attention, processing tokens sequentially from left to right, conditioning each prediction on previous tokens. |
| Training Objective | Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Randomly masks tokens in the input and trains the model to predict the masked tokens based on surrounding context.                               | Autoregressive Language Modeling. Trains the model to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding tokens.                          |
| Context         | Processes entire sequence in parallel, allowing for rich contextual understanding.                         | Processes tokens sequentially (one by one), building up context as it progresses.                    |
| Main Use Cases  | Primarily suited for tasks requiring understanding of the entire input sequence, such as text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and question answering.                   | Ideal for generative tasks like text generation, story generation, code generation, and translation.           |
| Attention Type   | Bidirectional self-attention.                                 | Unidirectional (masked) self-attention.                       |
| Output          | Typically generates contextualized embeddings for each input token, which can then be used for downstream tasks.                 | Produces sequential token generation (text or other content).          |

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

GPT, developed by OpenAI, represents a prominent family of decoder-only transformers. These models are pre-trained on vast text datasets to learn the nuances of language and generate human-like text.  This pre-training enables them to perform various natural language tasks with remarkable proficiency, even without task-specific training.

* **GPT-1 (2018):** The initial iteration of GPT, showcasing the potential of the decoder-only architecture. It had 117 million parameters, distributed across 12 decoder blocks with 768-dimensional embeddings and 12 attention heads per block.
* **GPT-2 (2019):** A significantly larger model, with the XL version boasting 1.5 billion parameters. This version comprised 48 decoder blocks with 1600-dimensional embeddings and 25 attention heads per block, enabling it to generate more coherent and lengthy text.
* **GPT-3 (2020):** A substantial leap in scale, with 175 billion parameters organized into 96 decoder blocks with 12,288-dimensional embeddings and 96 attention heads per block.

### GPT Input Encoding

GPT models employ Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization. BPE represents a subword tokenization technique that balances word-level and character-level representations. It breaks down words into smaller, meaningful sub-units (tokens) based on their frequency in the training data.  This approach allows for a more efficient representation of both common and infrequent words, handling out-of-vocabulary words gracefully by decomposing them into known subwords.  The vocabulary size varies depending on the GPT version, with GPT-2 utilizing around 50,000 tokens.


**Key Advantages of BPE:**

* **Handles morphology and new words effectively:** By breaking down complex words into subword units, BPE effectively handles morphological variations and adapts to new or unseen words.
* **Reduced vocabulary size:** Compared to character-level tokenization, BPE results in a smaller vocabulary, making training more efficient.
* **Robust out-of-vocabulary handling:**  BPE's ability to decompose unknown words into subwords or characters provides resilience against out-of-vocabulary scenarios.


<----------section---------->

### GPT Pre-training

GPT models are pre-trained using a next-token prediction objective, also known as autoregressive language modeling.  This training strategy involves predicting the next word (or token) in a sequence, effectively learning contextual relationships and linguistic patterns. The prediction is sequential, proceeding from left to right.  The training process utilizes massive and diverse datasets derived from internet text, allowing the model to absorb a wide range of linguistic structures and topical information.  GPT-1 was trained on BookCorpus, while subsequent versions like GPT-2 and GPT-3 utilized larger datasets like WebText and a combination of sources including Common Crawl, Books, and Wikipedia.  Training involves minimizing cross-entropy loss using optimizers like Adam, incorporating techniques like learning rate schedules (warm-up and decay) and large batch sizes to enhance training stability and generalization.

### GPT Fine-tuning

While pre-training lays the foundation for general language understanding, fine-tuning allows tailoring GPT models for specific tasks. This involves training the model on a smaller, labeled dataset curated for the target application.  Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained knowledge to the specific nuances of the downstream task, leading to improved performance.

**Examples of fine-tuning tasks:**

* Customer Support Automation
* Medical Assistance
* Legal Document Processing
* Coding Assistance
* Educational Tutoring
* Content Creation
* Virtual Personal Assistants
