This lesson explores fundamental concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on representing text in a format computers can understand. We will cover tokenization, bag-of-words representation, token normalization techniques, stemming and lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and introduce the spaCy library.

### Outline

1. Tokenization:  Breaking down text into individual units.
2. Bag of Words Representation:  Representing text as a collection of words and their frequencies.
3. Token Normalization: Cleaning and standardizing tokens.
4. Stemming and Lemmatization:  Reducing words to their root forms.
5. Part of Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical labels to tokens.
6. Introducing spaCy:  An overview of a powerful NLP library in Python.

### Tokenization

**Preparing the Environment**

Jupyter notebooks (installable through `pip install jupyter` and the Jupyter extension for VS Code) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) are recommended for the exercises.  A virtual environment (`python -m venv .env` and `source .env/bin/activate`) is good practice for managing dependencies.  The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are required (`pip install numpy pandas`).

**Text Segmentation**

Text segmentation divides text into meaningful units at different levels:

* **Paragraph Segmentation:** Dividing a document into paragraphs.  This often relies on visual cues like line breaks or indentation.
* **Sentence Segmentation:**  Splitting paragraphs into sentences. This typically uses punctuation like periods, question marks, and exclamation points.
* **Word Segmentation:** Separating sentences into individual words.  This can be complex due to punctuation, contractions, and language-specific rules.

Tokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation, breaking text into units called tokens.

**What is a Token?**

A token is the smallest meaningful unit of text considered by an NLP system. Examples include:

* **Words:** "The," "quick," "brown," "fox."
* **Punctuation Marks:** ".", ",", "!", "?". These can be important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure.
* **Emojis:** ðŸ˜€, ðŸ˜­. These convey emotional information.
* **Numbers:** "123," "3.14."  These can represent quantities or other numerical data.
* **Sub-words:** "pre-," "re-," "-ing," "-ed."  These can help with handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological information.
* **Phrases:** "ice cream," "New York."  These represent multi-word expressions that function as a single unit.

**Tokenizer Implementation**

While using whitespace as delimiters seems simple, it's inadequate for languages without clear word boundaries (e.g., Chinese).  Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.  A good tokenizer should correctly separate "51" and "." in a sentence like "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51."  We will explore more robust tokenization techniques later, including regular expressions and specialized tokenizers.

### Bag of Words Representation

**Turning Words into Numbers: One-hot Vectors**

One-hot encoding represents each word in a vocabulary as a vector. The vector's length equals the vocabulary size, and only the element corresponding to the word's index is 1; all others are 0.  While this preserves all information and allows document reconstruction, it creates very sparse, high-dimensional vectors.

**Limitations of One-hot Vectors:**

The sparsity leads to massive memory requirements for large vocabularies and corpora.  For example, a vocabulary of one million words and a corpus of 3,000 short books (3,500 sentences per book, 15 words per sentence) would require around 17.9 TB of storage using one-hot vectors, making it impractical.

**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**

BoW addresses the sparsity issue by summing the one-hot vectors for all words in a document.  This results in a single vector where each element represents the count of a specific word in the document.  While BoW is more memory-efficient, it loses word order information, which can be crucial for understanding meaning.  A binary variant of BoW simply indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word, disregarding its frequency.

**Binary BoW: Example**

Consider the corpus:

```python
sentences = [
    "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.",
    "Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.",
    "In addition to being a painter, Leonardo da Vinci was also a skilled engineer.",
    "Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle.",
    "The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most prestigious events in tennis.",
    "A tennis match is typically played as a best of three or best of five sets."
]
```

By generating a vocabulary and BoW vectors, we can observe the overlap in word usage between sentences.  This overlap, quantifiable using metrics like the dot product, allows us to compare documents and identify similarities.  BoW is foundational for document retrieval and search due to its efficiency and compatibility with hardware-accelerated binary operations.

### Token Normalization

**Improving Tokenization with Regular Expressions:**

Beyond whitespace, characters like tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), returns (`\r`), and punctuation also act as delimiters.  Regular expressions provide more control over tokenization, allowing us to handle these characters.  However, more complex scenarios like abbreviations, numbers, and special symbols may require dedicated tokenizers.

**Case Folding:**

Case folding reduces vocabulary size by converting all text to lowercase.  While this improves matching and recall, it can conflate words with different meanings (e.g., "US" vs. "us").  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is needed to preserve meaningful capitalization for proper nouns.

**Stop Words:**

Stop words are frequent words (e.g., "the," "a," "is") that often carry little semantic weight.  Removing them reduces noise and processing time, but can sometimes discard important contextual information (e.g., "Mark reported to the CEO" becomes "Mark reported CEO," changing the meaning).

**Combining Normalization Techniques:**

Combining regular expressions, case folding, and stop word removal significantly enhances basic text preprocessing. Libraries like NLTK offer extended stop word lists and other advanced preprocessing tools.

### Stemming and Lemmatization

**Stemming:**

Stemming reduces words to their root form (stem) by heuristically removing prefixes and suffixes.  While efficient, it can produce non-words (e.g., "running" becomes "runn").  The Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer (multilingual support) are common stemming algorithms available in NLTK.

**Lemmatization:**

Lemmatization, a more sophisticated approach, uses dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine a word's canonical form (lemma), considering its part of speech.  This always results in a valid word (e.g., "better" becomes "good"). Lemmatization is generally more accurate but computationally slower than stemming.

### Part of Speech (PoS) Tagging

PoS tagging assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to tokens, providing valuable information about sentence structure and word function.  This is crucial for tasks like lemmatization, parsing, and named entity recognition.  PoS tagging is inherently ambiguous due to words having multiple possible tags depending on context.  Algorithms use dictionaries, statistical models, and contextual information to disambiguate and assign the most likely tags. NLTK offers pre-trained PoS tagging models.

### Introducing spaCy

spaCy is a powerful open-source Python library for advanced NLP. It provides pre-trained language models with functionalities like tokenization, PoS tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, and NER.  spaCy offers detailed token attributes (e.g., `is_stop`, `pos_`, `lemma_`), simplifies common NLP tasks, and includes a built-in visualizer (displaCy) for analyzing syntactic dependencies and named entities.  spaCy's NER identifies and classifies real-world objects (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) with specific labels.
