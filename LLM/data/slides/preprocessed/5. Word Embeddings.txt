
would rank the pages based on the TF-IDF scores of the words you typed.
But this approach had a big problem. If you typed in "apple" and the web
page had the word "apple" but also the word "fruit," the search engine
wouldn t know that "apple" and "fruit" are related. So it would rank the
page lower than it should have.
To solve this problem, search engines started to use word embeddings.
Instead of just looking for the exact words you typed, they started to look
for words that were similar to the words you typed. So if you typed in
"apple," the search engine would look for pages that had words like
"fruit," "orchard," "tree," and "eat." This made the search results much
better.
6.2.2 Information filtering
Another problem with TF-IDF vectors is that they don t tell you much about
the meaning of a document. So if you wanted to filter out documents that
were about a certain topic, you had to look at the words in the document
and decide if they were related to the topic. This was a lot of work.
But with word embeddings, you can just look at the vector of the document
and see if it is close to the vectors of documents that are about the topic.
This makes it much easier to filter out documents that are not about the
topic.
6.2.3 Text classification
Another problem with TF-IDF vectors is that they don t tell you much about
the meaning of a document. So if you wanted to classify a document as
belonging to a certain category, you had to look at the words in the document
and decide if they were related to the category. This was a lot of work.
But with word embeddings, you can just look at the vector of the document
and see if it is close to the vectors of documents that belong to the category.
This makes it much easier to classify documents.
6.2.4 Other applications
There are many other applications where word embeddings can be useful.
For example, you can use word embeddings to generate new sentences
automatically. You can use word embeddings to translate text from one
language to another. You can use word embeddings to answer questions about
text. And you can
