
Guardrails-AI "rail" language [19]


Informazioni aggiuntive:
The Guardrails-AI package is a Python library for implementing guardrails for large language models. It provides a simple and flexible way to define rules for filtering, validating, and formatting the outputs of a language model. The package uses a domain-specific language called RAIL (RAIL Language for Implementing Guardrails) to define the rules.

The RAIL language is a XML-like language that allows you to define complex rules for filtering, validating, and formatting the outputs of a language model. It provides a way to define conditions, actions, and variables that can be used to create complex rules.

The LangChain package is a Python library for chaining prompts and filtering outputs of a language model. It allows you to define a sequence of prompts and filters that can be used to guide the behavior of the language model. It can be integrated with the Guardrails-AI package to add additional guardrails to the outputs of the language model.

The OpenAI Moderation API is a pre-built API for detecting unsafe content in the outputs of a language model. It can be used to add an additional layer of safety to the outputs of a language model.

The SpaCy Matcher class is a Python library for defining patterns for extracting information from text. It can be used to extract specific information from the outputs of a language model, such as names, dates, and numbers.

The Python fuzzy regular expression package is a Python library for working with regular expressions that allow for fuzzy matching. It can be used to create rules for filtering and validating the outputs of a language model that are more flexible and forgiving of small errors.

The Eleuther AI's LM evaluation harness package is a Python library for evaluating the performance of large language models. It provides a way to evaluate the outputs of a language model on a variety of tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and translation.
