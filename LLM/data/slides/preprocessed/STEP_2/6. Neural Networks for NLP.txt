### Recurrent Neural Networks

#### Neural Networks and NLP

Neural networks are widely used in text processing. A limitation of feedforward networks is the lack of memory. Each input is processed independently, without maintaining any state. To process a text, the entire sequence of words must be presented at once. The entire text must become a single data point. This is the approach used with BoW or TF-IDF vectors. A similar approach is averaging the word vectors of a text.

#### Neural Networks with Memory

When you read a text, you:

* Process sentences and words one by one.
* Maintain the memory of what you have read previously.
* Continuously update an internal model as new information arrives.

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) adopts the same principle:

* It processes sequences of information by iterating on the elements of the sequence (e.g., the words of a text represented as word embeddings).
* It maintains a state containing information about what has been seen so far.

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (Structure)

RNNs utilize feedforward network layers (circles) composed of one or more neurons. The output of the hidden layer goes to the output layer and is also fed back as input to the hidden layer along with the normal input in the next time step.

#### Unrolling the RNN

Unrolling an RNN helps visualize its operation over time. Each time step represents the network processing a new token in the sequence. The weights are shared across all time steps.

#### Inside the RNN

At each time step *t*, the RNN receives an input vector and the hidden vector from the previous time step (t-1). The first input (t=0) has no past, so the initial hidden state is typically zero.  Trainable weights connect the input to the hidden layer, the hidden to the output layer, and the hidden layer to itself (for the recurrent connection).

#### Using RNNs with Text

The RNN processes text sequentially, one token at a time. The output from each time step is fed back into the network as input for the next time step, allowing the network to maintain a "memory" of the preceding context.  Only the final output is typically used for tasks like classification.

#### RNN Training

During training, backpropagation through time (BPTT) is used to adjust the network's weights. The error is calculated based on the final output and propagated back through all time steps.

#### What are RNNs Good For?

RNNs are suitable for various sequence processing tasks:

* **One-to-Many:** One input generates a sequence of outputs (e.g., text generation).
* **Many-to-One:** A sequence of inputs produces a single output (e.g., text classification).
* **Many-to-Many:** A sequence of inputs generates a sequence of outputs (e.g., machine translation).

RNNs excel at handling variable-length text sequences, eliminating the need for padding or truncation.

#### RNNs for Text Generation

In text generation, the output at each time step is significant. Error is calculated and backpropagated at each step, influencing all network weights.

#### RNN Variants

* **Bidirectional RNN:** Processes the sequence forward and backward, concatenating outputs at each time step. This helps capture patterns missed by unidirectional RNNs.
* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Addresses the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs by introducing a memory state and gates to control information flow.
* **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** A simpler alternative to LSTM, also designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
* **Stacked LSTM:** Multiple LSTM layers are stacked to learn more complex representations.

#### Using Ragged Tensors

Ragged tensors handle variable-length sequences efficiently, eliminating padding overhead. They are available in TensorFlow and similar functionality exists in PyTorch (Packed Sequences).

### Intro to Text Generation

#### Generative Models

Generative models create new text based on learned patterns. Unlike discriminative models (used for classification), they produce original data. RNNs and Transformers (discussed later) are examples of generative models.

#### Applications

* Machine Translation
* Question Answering
* Automatic Summarization
* Text Completion
* Dialogue Systems
* Creative Writing

#### Language Model

A language model predicts the probability of the next token given the previous ones. It captures the statistical structure of language.  New sequences are generated by sampling from this model, starting with a seed text and iteratively adding predicted tokens.

#### LM Training

The RNN receives a token and predicts the next one. The prediction is compared with the actual next token, and the error is backpropagated to update the network weights. This happens at each step.

#### Sampling

Generative models sample from possible outputs, introducing randomness. Temperature controls this randomness: lower temperatures make the model more deterministic, while higher temperatures increase creativity.

#### Temperature

Temperature (T) modifies the probability distribution: `q_i = exp(log(p_i) / T) / sum(exp(log(p_j) / T))`.  Higher temperatures increase randomness and surprise, while lower temperatures favor more predictable outputs.

### Building a Poetry Generator

#### Leopardi Poetry Generator

This example uses a corpus of Leopardi's poetry to train a character-level language model.

#### Extract the Training Samples

The corpus is divided into sequences of characters (maxlen). Each sequence serves as input, and the next character is the target.

#### Build and Train the Model

An LSTM model is trained to predict the next character in a sequence.

#### Generate a new Poetry

Helper functions sample from the model's predictions and generate text from a seed.  Temperature controls the randomness of the generated poetry.
