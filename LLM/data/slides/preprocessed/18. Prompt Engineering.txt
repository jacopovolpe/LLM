
don't have a large enough LLM to answer the question directly.
You can also use RAG to augment your LLM prompts. For example, if you
want to ask your LLM to write a short story about a character who is a
mathematician, you can use RAG to retrieve a few sentences about mathematicians
from a database of curated documents. You can then use these sentences to
augment your LLM prompt.
Another approach is to use a combination of LLMs and rule-based systems.
For example, you can use an LLM to generate a list of possible answers to a
question, and then use a rule-based system to select the best answer. This
approach is called hybrid systems.

In this lesson, we will focus on Prompt Engineering, a relatively new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications and research areas. The main goals of Prompt Engineering are to:

1. Enhance understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs
2. Improve LLM performance on a broad range of tasks (e.g., question answering, arithmetic reasoning, ...)
3. Help interfacing LLMs with domain knowledge and external resources
4. Augment LLMs with domain knowledge and external resources

Writing Good Prompts

* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results
* Be clear, specific, and descriptive to achieve better outcomes
* Consider using examples to guide the model's output
* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format
