Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica. Lesson 8: Building a Chatbot. Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco, DIEM â€“ University of Salerno.

**Exercise: Building a Pizzeria Chatbot**

Develop a chatbot to assist with pizzeria operations. Users can:

*   Request the pizzeria's menu.
*   Order a pizza that is available on the menu (just one pizza, no beverage).
*   Upon order confirmation, the bot will log the date, the user ID, and the kind of ordered pizza (use a custom action).
*   The bot has a web-based GUI.

Hint: Start with a dummy bot.

Example conversation:

User: Can I have the menu?
Bot: What kind of pizza would you like? We have Parenti, Pepperoni, Vegetarian...
User: Pepperoni
Bot: You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?
User: Yes
Bot: Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!

**Hints**

Start with a dummy bot:

```bash
mkdir pizzaBot
cd pizzaBot
rasa init --no-prompt
```

Configure and run the REST and the Actions servers:

```bash
rasa run --cors "*"
rasa run actions
```

Use a Web frontend like:
