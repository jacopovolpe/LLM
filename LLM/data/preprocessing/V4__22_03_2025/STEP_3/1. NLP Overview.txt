<----------section---------->

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

NLU is a subfield of NLP dedicated to enabling machines to understand human language.

*   It focuses on extracting meaning, context, and intent from text, going beyond mere keyword recognition.
*   Text is transformed into a numerical representation called an embedding, allowing mathematical operations and comparisons. Embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and phrases.

**Who uses Embeddings:**

*   **Search Engines:** Use embeddings to interpret the underlying meaning of search queries, allowing for more accurate and relevant search results. For example, understanding that "best phone under $500" is semantically similar to "top-rated smartphone less than 500 dollars."
*   **Email Clients:** Utilize embeddings to detect spam and classify emails by importance, filtering out unwanted messages and prioritizing important correspondence.
*   **Social Media:** Employ embeddings to moderate posts by identifying hate speech, offensive content, and misinformation. They also help understand user sentiment towards specific topics or brands.
*   **CRM Tools:** Analyze customer inquiries and route them to the appropriate departments by understanding the context and intent of the message. For instance, a question about billing is routed to the finance department.
*   **Recommender Systems:** Suggest articles, products, or content to users based on their past behavior and preferences. Embeddings help identify items with similar semantic content.

<----------section---------->

### Natural Language Generation (NLG)

NLG is the complementary subfield of NLP focused on creating human-like text.

*   It involves generating coherent, contextually appropriate text that is often indistinguishable from text written by a human.
*   NLG relies on numerical representations of meaning and sentiment to produce text that effectively conveys the intended message.

**Applications:**

*   **Machine Translation:** Converts text from one language to another, enabling cross-lingual communication. Examples include Google Translate and DeepL.
*   **Text Summarization:** Creates concise summaries of long documents, preserving key information. This is useful for quickly understanding the main points of articles, reports, and books.
*   **Dialogue Processing:** Powers chatbots and virtual assistants by providing relevant and context-aware responses in conversations. This allows for more natural and engaging interactions.
*   **Content Creation:** Generates articles, reports, stories, poetry, and other forms of creative writing. This can assist writers in brainstorming ideas, creating drafts, and automating content production.

<----------section---------->

### Example: Conversational Agents

Conversational agents (chatbots, virtual assistants) integrate several NLP components to simulate human conversation:

*   **Speech recognition:** Converts spoken language into text.
*   **Language analysis:** Analyzes the structure and meaning of the text.
*   **Dialogue processing:** Manages the flow of the conversation and determines appropriate responses.
*   **Information retrieval:** Accesses and retrieves relevant information to answer user queries.
*   **Text to speech:** Converts text responses into spoken language.

**Example conversation:**

*   User: "Open the pod bay doors, Hal."
*   Hal: "I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that."
*   User: "What are you talking about, Hal?"
*   Hal: "I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen."

This exchange from *2001: A Space Odyssey* illustrates the capabilities and potential limitations of conversational agents, highlighting issues of intent recognition and autonomous decision-making.

<----------section---------->

### Conversational Agents in Movies

Conversational agents are frequently depicted in movies, reflecting the ongoing fascination with creating machines that can communicate and interact like humans. These cinematic representations often explore both the benefits and the potential risks associated with advanced AI.

<----------section---------->

### NLP is Hard

The complexities of NLP arise from the inherent ambiguities in human language:

"I made her duck… what does it mean?"

*   **Duck:** Does "duck" refer to the waterfowl (noun) or the action of lowering one's head (verb)?
*   **Make:** Does "make" mean to cook (prepare food) or to cause someone to do something?
*   **Her:** Does "her" indicate something belonging to her or something done for her?

**Possible meanings:**

*   I cooked waterfowl for her.
*   I cooked waterfowl belonging to her.
*   I created the (plaster?) duck she owns.
*   I caused her to quickly lower her head or body.
*   I waved my magic wand and turned her into undifferentiated waterfowl. (Humorous interpretation)

This example demonstrates the multiple layers of interpretation that can be applied to even a short sentence.

<----------section---------->

### Ambiguity

Natural language is inherently ambiguous, leading to challenges in NLP.

*   **One input can mean many different things:** A single sentence or phrase can have multiple valid interpretations depending on context and understanding.
*   **Many inputs can mean the same thing:** Different sentences or phrases can convey the same meaning, making it difficult for machines to recognize semantic equivalence.

**Levels of ambiguity:**

*   **Lexical ambiguity:** Arises from the multiple meanings of words. For example, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.
*   **Syntactic ambiguity:** Occurs when a sentence can be parsed in multiple ways, leading to different interpretations. For example, "I saw the man on the hill with a telescope."
*   **Interpreting partial information:** Involves understanding the reference of pronouns and other incomplete information. For example, in the sentence "John told Bill that he was wrong," it is unclear whether "he" refers to John or Bill.
*   **Contextual information:** Context significantly impacts the meaning of a sentence. The same sentence can have different interpretations based on the surrounding text and the overall situation.

<----------section---------->

### Ambiguity Examples

*   "I saw bats… ?" This could mean seeing the animal or seeing baseball bats.
*   "Call me a cab… ?" This could be a request to phone a taxi, or mean something else entirely.

<----------section---------->

### NLP and Linguistics

NLP techniques draw upon various aspects of linguistics to better understand and process human language:

*   **Phonetics:** Understanding the physical sounds of speech and how they are produced and perceived. This is important for speech recognition and synthesis.
*   **Morphology:** Knowledge of the structure and formation of words, including their meaningful components (morphemes). This helps in tasks such as stemming and lemmatization.
*   **Syntax:** Understanding the rules and structures governing the arrangement of words in sentences. This is essential for parsing and grammatical analysis.
*   **Semantics:** Insight into the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. This allows for a deeper understanding of the content and intent of the text.
*   **Pragmatics:** Understanding how context influences the interpretation of meaning. This enables machines to go beyond literal meanings and understand implied or intended messages.

<----------section---------->

### NLP vs Linguistics

**Linguistics:**

*   Primarily focused on the study of language itself.
*   Explores the structure, meaning, and use of language from a theoretical perspective.
*   May employ computational methods and tools as part of computational linguistics, but the primary goal is linguistic analysis and understanding.

**NLP:**

*   Focused on creating computational capabilities that utilize human language.
*   Designs and implements algorithms to understand and generate human language for practical applications.
*   Applies results from linguistics to develop working systems for tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and text summarization.

## History of NLP

### First Steps of NLP

NLP has experienced periods of rapid advancement and relative stagnation, reflecting the challenges and evolving approaches in the field.

*   Its history is influenced by the growth of computational resources and shifts in research methodologies.

**1950's and 1960's**

*   Machine translation was the initial application that sparked interest in NLP, driven by the Cold War and the desire to automatically translate documents.
*   The first machine translation systems used dictionary lookup and basic word order rules to produce translations. These systems quickly faced limitations due to the complexity and ambiguity of language.
*   The 1950s saw considerable excitement and optimism, with researchers predicting that machine translation could be solved within a few years.

<----------section---------->

### Machine Translation in 50s

**Example:**

Given:

```
Dictionary: Red -> Rosso
            House -> Casa
```

Translate:

```
The red house -> Il rosso casa   (incorrect)
```

But it should be:

```
La casa rossa (correct)
```

Dictionary lookup alone is insufficient to deal with syntactical differences between languages, such as adjective-noun order. This example highlights the need for more sophisticated methods beyond simple word-for-word translation.

<----------section---------->

### How to deal with language ambiguity?

This question became central to NLP research, prompting investigations into linguistic structures and computational methods.

<----------section---------->

### Generative Grammars

**1957: Chomsky’s Generative Grammar**

*   Noam Chomsky's theory of generative grammar proposed a system of rules for generating all possible grammatically correct sentences in a language.
*   This enabled prediction of grammatical correctness, providing a formal framework for understanding language structure.
*   Chomsky's work heavily influenced research in machine translation and other NLP tasks.

**1966: The Reality Check**

*   Early translation systems failed to meet expectations due to their inability to handle the ambiguity and complexity of natural language.
*   This led to a reassessment of the feasibility of machine translation and a shift in research focus.

<----------section---------->

### ALPAC Report

**Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee**

*   Established to assess advancements in computational linguistics and machine translation.
*   The 1966 ALPAC report recommended halting research into machine translation due to the lack of significant progress and cost-effectiveness.
*   The report suggested shifting the focus from developing end-to-end machine translation systems to enhancing tools that assist human translators.
*   The ALPAC report had a significant impact on NLP and AI research, contributing to the first AI winter, a period of reduced funding and interest in the field.

### The Turing Test

**Successes with Turing test**

*   A (controversial) success in 2014: a chatbot mimicking the answer of a 13 years old boy managed to fool judges.
*   Since then, other (controversial) successes have been claimed.

**Limitations of Turing Test**

*   Not reproducible: The results can be subjective and vary depending on the judges and the specific interactions.
*   Is emulating humans necessary for achieving intelligence? Some argue that intelligence should be measured by the ability to solve problems, not by mimicking human behavior.
*   Many AI researchers have shifted focus to other benchmarks that are more measurable and objective.
*   Less commonly used today as a primary measure of AI progress.

<----------section---------->

### Raise of Symbolic Approaches

**1970's and 1980's:**

*   Programmers started creating structured representations of real-world information for computer understanding, leading to the development of ontologies.
*   Complex rule-based systems were developed for various NLP tasks, including parsing, morphology, semantics, and reference resolution.

**Main applications were:**

*   **Expert Systems:** Mimicked human expertise in specific domains, using rule-based reasoning to solve problems and provide advice.
*   **Information Retrieval:** Enhanced search and data extraction by using structured representations and rule-based systems to understand and process queries.

**Main limitations were:**
