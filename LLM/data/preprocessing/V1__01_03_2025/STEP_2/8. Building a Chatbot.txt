**Exercise: Building a Pizzeria Chatbot**

Develop a chatbot to assist with pizzeria operations:

* Users can request the pizzeria's menu.
* Users can order a pizza that is available in the menu (just one, no beverage).
* Upon order confirmation, the bot will log the date, the user ID, and the kind of ordered pizza (use a custom action).
* The bot has a web-based GUI.

*Hint: Start with a dummy bot.*

**Hints:**

Start with a dummy bot:

* `mkdir pizzaBot`
* `cd pizzaBot`
* `rasa init --no-prompt`

Configure and run the REST and the Actions servers:

* `rasa run --cors "*"`
* `rasa run actions`

Use a Web frontend like:

`https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0`


**(Example Conversation - From OCR Text)**

* **User:** can i have the menu?
* **Bot:** What kind of pizza would you like? We have Margherita, Pepperoni, Vegetarian, and SO Mushroom.
* **User:** Pepperoni
* **Bot:** You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?
* **User:** yes
* **Bot:** Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!


This cleaned-up version removes the redundant information and presents the exercise instructions and hints clearly. The example conversation from the OCR text is included as a separate section for context, demonstrating a potential interaction flow.  Note the correction of "gqithub" to "github" in the URL.
