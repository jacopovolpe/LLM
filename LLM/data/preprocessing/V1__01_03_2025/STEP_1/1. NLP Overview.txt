Many Other Applications…8 CHAPTER  1 Packets of thought (NLP overview)
1.3 Practical applications
Natural language processing is  everywhere. It’s so ubiquito us that some of the exam-
ples in table 1.1 may surprise you.
A search engine can provide mo re meaningful results if it  indexes web pages or docu-
ment archives in a way that takes into ac count the meaning of natural language text.
Autocomplete uses NLP to complete yo ur thought and is common among search
engines and mobile phone keyboards. Many  word processors, br owser plugins, and
text editors have spelling correctors, gr ammar checkers, concordance composers, and
most recently, style coaches. Some dialog  e n g i n e s  ( c h a t b o t s )  u s e  n a t u r a l  l a n g u a g e
search to find a response to th eir conversation partner’s message.
 N L P  p i p e l i n e s  t h a t  g e n e r a t e  ( c o m p o s e )  text can be used not only to compose
short replies in chatbots and virtual assistan ts, but also to assemble much longer pas-
sages of text. The Associated Press uses NLP “robot journalists” to write entire finan-
cial news articles and sporting event reports. 7 Bots can compose weather forecasts that
sound a lot like what your hometown weat her person might say, perhaps because
human meteorologists use word processors  with NLP features to draft scripts.
 NLP spam filters in early email programs helped email overtake telephone and fax
communication channels in the '90s. And the spam filters have retained their edge in
the cat and mouse game between spam filter s and spam generators for email, but may
be losing in other environments like social networks. An estimated 20% of the tweets

Importance of NLP

Natural language is the most important part of
Artificial Intelligence

John Searle, Philosopher

Natural language processing is a cornerstone of
artificial intelligence, allowing computers to
read and understand human language, as well
as to produce and recognize speech

Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO
Natural language processing Is one of the most

important fields in artificial intelligence and
also one of the most difficult

Dan Jurafsky, Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science
at Stanford University

Definitions

Natural language processing is the set of methods for
making human language accessible to computers

(Jacob Eisenstein)

Natural language processing is the field at the
intersection of computer science and linguistics

(Christopher Manning)

Make computers to understand natural language to do
certain task humans can do such as translation,
summarization, questions answering

(Behrooz Mansouri)

Definitions

Natural language processing is an area of research in
computer science and artificial intelligence concerned
with processing natural languages such as English or
Mandarin.

This processing generally involves translating natural
language into data that a computer can use to learn
about the world.

And this understanding of the world is sometimes used to
generate natural language text that reflects that
understanding.

(Natural Language Processing in Action)

Natural Language Understanding

A subfield of NLP focused on transforming human
language in a way that machines can process
® Involves extracting meaning, context, and intent from text

° Text is transformed into a numerical representation (embedding)

Who uses Embeddings:

° Search Engines... to interpret the meaning behind search queries

°® Email Clients... to detect spam and classify emails as important or not
® Social Media... to moderate posts and understand user sentiment
CRM Tools... to analyze customer inquiries and route them

Recommender Systems... to suggest articles, products, or content

Natural Language Generation

A subfield of NLP focused on generating human-like text
® Involves creating coherent, contextually appropriate text

° Based ona numerical representation of the meaning and
sentiment you would like to convey

Applications:
°® Machine Translation... translates text from one language to another

° Text Summarization... creation of concise summaries of long documents
preserving key information

® Dialogue Processing... powers chatbots and virtual assistants to provide
relevant responses in conversations

Content Creation... generation of articles, reports, stories, poetry, ...

Example: Conversational Agents

Conversational agents include:
® Speech recognition

® Language analysis

* Dialogue processing

© Information retrieval

* Text to speech

| made her duck... what does it means?

°® Duck: noun (waterfowl) or verb (getting down)?

° Make: cook X or cause X to do Y?

° Her: for her or belonging to her?

Possible meanings:

® | cooked waterfowl for her

® | cooked waterfowl belonging to her

° Icreated the (plaster?) duck she owns

® | caused her to quickly lower her head or body

| waved my magic wand and turned her into undifferentiated waterfowl

Ambiguity

Natural language is extremely rich in form and structure
and very ambiguous

°® One input can mean many different things

°® Many input can mean the same thing

Levels of ambiguity

° Lexical ambiguity: different meanings of words

® Syntactic ambiguity: different ways to parse the sentence

° Interpreting partial information: how to interpret pronouns

® Contextual information: context of the sentence may affect the
meaning of that sentence

they are produced and perceived

° Morphology: Knowledge of the structure and formation of words,
including their meaningful components (morphemes)

® Syntax: Understanding the rules and structures governing the
arrangement of words in sentences

® Semantics: Insight into the meaning of words, phrases, and
sentences

Pragmatics: Understanding how context influences the
interpretation of meaning

NLP vs Linguistics

Linguistics:
® Focused on the study of language
° Explores the structure, meaning, and use of language

° May employ computational methods and tools as part of
computational linguistics

NLP:

® Focused on providing computational capabilities that utilize
human language

® Designs and implements algorithms to understand and generate
human language

Applies results from linguistics to develop practical applications

_ messages
J ° The interrogator should classify the human

and the machine

The Touring Test

Capabilities for passing the Turing Test

of a 13 years old boy

® Since then, other (controversial) successes

Limitations of Turing Test
* Not reproducible
° Is emulating humans necessary for achieving intelligence?

° Many Al researchers have shifted focus to other benchmarks
Y

1970's and 1980's:

Less commonly used today

Raise of Symbolic Approaches

°® Programmers started creating structured representations of real-
world information for computer understanding (ontologies)

* Complex rule-based systems were developed for various NLP
tasks, including parsing, morphology, semantics, reference, ...

°® Main applications were:
°® Expert Systems: mimicked human expertise in specific domains
° Information Retrieval: enhanced search and data extraction

® Main limitations were:

° Flexibility: challenges in adapting to new or ambiguous contexts

® Scalability: difficulty handling large-scale or diverse data

Statistical Revolution

1990'S:
°® The computing power increased substantially

® Statistical models with simple representations started to
outperform complex hand-coded linguistic rules

® Learn patterns from data
® Can handle variations and complexities in natural language
° Large corpora became essential

® Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks was invented by
Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997

Whenever | fire a linguist, our machine translation
performance improves (Fred Jelinek, IBM)

Advances in NLP

2000'S
© Increased Use of Neural Networks

® Introduction of Word Embeddings Mathematics

Statistics
° Words are represented as dense vectors of numbers

°® Words with similar meanings are associated

with similar vectors Tiger
° Early algorithms struggled to efficiently Lion

learn these representations

2006: launch of Google Translate

° The first commercially successful NLP system

® Utilized statistical models to automatically
translate documents

Deep Learning Era

2010's:
° LSTM and CNN became widely adopted for NLP

° The availability of large text corpora enabled the training of
increasingly complex models

Word2Vec (2013):

° Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space
° The first algorithm to efficiently learn word embeddings

* Enables semantic operations with word vector

Paved the way for more advanced models such as GloVe, fastText,
ELMo, BERT, COLBERT, GPT, ...

Deep Learning Era

Sequence-to-Sequence Models (2014):
® Introduction of the encoder-decoder architecture:
® Encoder: Encodes the input into a context vector
°® Decoder: Decodes the output from the context vector

® Useful for automatic translation, question answering, text
summarization, text generation, ...
