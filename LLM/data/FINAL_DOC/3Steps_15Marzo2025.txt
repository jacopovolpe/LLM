**Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models**

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 9: Transformers I**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**
**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Transformer model, a groundbreaking architecture in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  It begins by explaining the limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which motivated the development of Transformers.  Following this, the core components of the Transformer model are detailed, focusing on the mechanism of self-attention.

<----------section---------->

**Limitations of RNNs**

RNNs, while powerful for sequential data processing, face several inherent limitations that hinder their performance, especially with long sequences:

* **Vanishing Gradients:** This problem arises during backpropagation through time (BPTT), the algorithm used to train RNNs.  As gradients are propagated back through the network, they can diminish exponentially, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The repeated multiplication of small derivative values during BPTT leads to the vanishing gradient, effectively preventing the network from adjusting its weights based on earlier parts of the sequence.

* **Slow Training:** RNNs process data sequentially, meaning they handle one input at a time.  This inherent sequentiality prevents the network from leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, resulting in significantly slower training times, especially for long sequences.  The network must complete processing ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 before starting on ùë•ùëñ, creating a bottleneck.

* **Limited Long-Term Memory:** RNNs struggle to retain information from earlier stages of the sequence when processing long sequences. Information from the beginning of a sequence is gradually lost as the network proceeds, making it difficult for the model to understand and utilize context over extended spans of text. This is typically represented by a context vector, which has a fixed size and thus cannot effectively store information from arbitrarily long sequences.


<----------section---------->

**Transformer**

Introduced by Google Brain in 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by addressing the shortcomings of RNNs. It enables parallel processing of sequence elements, significantly speeding up training and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. The number of layers traversed is independent of the sequence length, contributing to its efficiency and ability to handle long-range dependencies. While initially designed for machine translation, its components are adaptable to various NLP tasks.

<----------section---------->

**Transformer Components**

The Transformer model comprises several key components:

* **Input:** The raw textual data.
* **Tokenization:**  The process of breaking down the input text into individual units, or tokens (words, subwords, or characters). Each token is then assigned a unique numerical identifier.
* **Input Embedding:**  Tokens are represented as dense vectors in a continuous Euclidean space. This embedding captures semantic relationships between words, placing similar words closer together and dissimilar words further apart.
* **Positional Encoding:**  Since the attention mechanism is order-agnostic, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings.  These encodings provide information about the position of each token in the sequence, enabling the model to understand word order.
* **Encoder:** Processes the input sequence to generate an intermediate representation. It consists of multiple identical layers, each employing self-attention and a feed-forward network.
* **Decoder:** Generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation. It also uses masked self-attention to prevent "peeking" at future tokens during training.
* **Output:** The generated sequence of tokens, which can then be converted back to text.


<----------section---------->

**Input: Tokenization**

Tokenization is a fundamental step in NLP.  It transforms text into a sequence of discrete units (tokens), which are then mapped to unique numerical IDs. This process allows the model to represent and process textual data in a structured manner.

<----------section---------->

**Input Embedding**

Word embeddings are crucial for representing words in a format that machine learning models can understand. They project tokens into a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.  Similar words tend to have similar vector representations, allowing the model to learn meaningful associations.

<----------section---------->

**Positional Encoding**

The attention mechanism, while powerful, doesn't inherently consider word order.  Positional encodings address this limitation by adding position-specific information to the input embeddings. These encodings utilize periodic functions (sine and cosine) to create unique representations for each position.  This ensures that the model differentiates between sequences with the same words in different orders.

<----------section---------->

**Encoder**

The encoder transforms the input sequence into a contextualized representation.  It consists of stacked identical blocks, each containing multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward layer.  Crucially, the encoder processes all input tokens in parallel, a key advantage over sequential RNNs.

<----------section---------->

**Self Attention**

Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when encoding a specific word.  It helps the model understand relationships between words within the same sentence.  For example, in the sentence "The animal didn‚Äôt cross the street because it was too wide," self-attention helps the model associate "it" with "the street" rather than "the animal."

The attention mechanism employs three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).  These matrices are derived from the input embeddings through linear transformations.  The attention weights are calculated using scaled dot-product attention, which measures the similarity between query and key vectors.  These weights are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the input sequence.  The scaling factor (1/‚àödk) is crucial for preventing extremely small gradients during training, especially with high-dimensional vectors.

<----------section---------->

**Additional Context and Insights**

The core innovation of the Transformer model lies in its use of self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to consider the relationships between all words in a sequence simultaneously. This contrasts with RNNs, which process sequences sequentially. The parallel processing capabilities of transformers, coupled with their ability to handle long-range dependencies, have made them a cornerstone of modern NLP.

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a subword tokenization technique, is often used with transformers to handle large vocabularies efficiently. BPE allows the model to represent rare or unseen words as combinations of more frequent subword units.

Transformers are highly scalable, meaning their capacity can be increased by stacking more layers and using larger datasets.  This scalability, combined with the parallelizability of attention, has enabled the development of extremely large language models (LLMs) capable of performing complex tasks like question answering, text generation, and translation.


The omission of recurrence in Transformers necessitates positional encodings to incorporate word order information. These encodings are crucial for tasks where word order is essential, like translation and grammar parsing.

The combination of BPE, self-attention, and positional encoding allows Transformers to effectively handle long sequences and capture complex relationships between words, leading to significant advancements in NLP.  These models can learn rich representations of text, enabling them to outperform traditional methods on various tasks. The attention mechanism is a key component of this success, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating the output.

> "Open the pod bay doors, Hal."
>
> "I‚Äôm sorry, Dave, I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt do that."
>
> "What are you talking about, Hal?"
>
> "I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen."


#### The Challenge of Ambiguity in NLP

Ambiguity poses a significant hurdle for NLP.  The sentence "I made her duck" demonstrates how multiple interpretations can arise from a single sentence:

* Cooking waterfowl for her.
* Cooking waterfowl belonging to her.
* Creating a duck object for her.
* Causing her to lower her head or body.



#### Levels of Ambiguity

Natural language's richness and inherent ambiguity create various challenges for NLP:

* **Lexical Ambiguity:** Words with multiple meanings (e.g., "I saw bats").

<----------section---------->

### History of Natural Language Processing

#### Early Stages and Machine Translation

NLP's history has been marked by periods of progress and setbacks, influenced by available computational resources and evolving approaches.  Machine translation emerged as a primary focus in the 1950s and 1960s. Early systems, based on dictionary lookups and simple rules, struggled with ambiguity, leading to the ALPAC Report (1966) and reduced research funding.


#### Generative Grammars and the ALPAC Report

Noam Chomsky's work on generative grammar (1957) influenced NLP. However, early translation systems faced challenges in handling language complexity. The ALPAC Report (1966) recommended a shift away from fully automated machine translation toward tools that assist human translators, contributing to the first AI winter.


#### ELIZA and the Turing Test

ELIZA, developed in the 1960s, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist using pattern matching.  Alan Turing's Turing Test (1950) aimed to evaluate a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence. While influential, both ELIZA's limited capabilities and the Turing Test's limitations prompted a search for more robust benchmarks.


#### Symbolic Approaches (1970s-1980s)

The 1970s and 1980s witnessed the development of rule-based systems and ontologies for expert systems and information retrieval.  However, these systems struggled with flexibility and scalability.


#### The Statistical Revolution (1990s)

Increased computing power enabled statistically based models trained on large corpora of data to surpass rule-based systems.  This era saw the invention of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.


####  NLP Advancements in the 2000s

Neural networks and word embeddings gained prominence. Google Translate, a commercially successful statistical machine translation system, launched in 2006.


#### The Deep Learning Era (2010s)

LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures became widely adopted.  Word2Vec (2013) revolutionized word embedding learning.  Sequence-to-sequence models (2014) introduced the encoder-decoder framework.  Virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and Google Assistant emerged. The Transformer architecture (2017) with its attention mechanism significantly advanced NLP capabilities.


#### Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs, utilizing vast datasets and immense computational resources, emerged as powerful tools for various NLP tasks, including text generation, translation, chatbots, code generation, question answering, and summarization.


#### Multimodal LLMs

We will explore the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, the Encoder and Decoder structures, Masked Multi-Head Attention, Encoder-Decoder Attention, and the overall pipeline of the Transformer. This understanding is crucial for comprehending how Transformers process sequential data and achieve state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks.

`<----------section---------->`

### Multi-head Attention

Self-attention allows a model to consider the relationships between different words in a sequence when processing each word. However, a single attention mechanism might not capture all the nuances of these relationships. Multi-head attention addresses this limitation by employing multiple "heads," each with its own set of learned weight matrices.  This allows the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously.

Each head performs a scaled dot-product attention operation. The results from these parallel computations are then concatenated and transformed through another linear layer. This final transformation combines the various perspectives offered by the different heads into a unified representation.  Multi-head attention allows the model to capture a richer understanding of the relationships within the sequence compared to a single-head approach.

Just like in single-head attention, Multi-Head Attention incorporates Add & Norm (skip connections and layer normalization) and Feed Forward layers. The Add & Norm component normalizes the output, stabilizing training and providing a regularization effect, while the residual connections (Add) help mitigate vanishing gradients, which is crucial for training deep networks. The Feed Forward layers introduce non-linear transformations, enabling the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships between words in the sequence.


`<----------section---------->`

### Transformer‚Äôs Encoder

The Transformer‚Äôs Encoder processes the input sequence to generate a contextualized representation for each word.  Crucially, because self-attention mechanisms don't inherently account for word order, the encoder incorporates positional encoding. This is typically achieved by adding sinusoidal functions to the input embeddings, providing information about the position of each word in the sequence.

Each encoder block consists of a multi-head self-attention layer followed by the Add & Norm and Feed Forward layers as described previously. This architecture allows the encoder to process each word in the context of all other words in the input sequence, including itself.

The encoder's design, where each block maintains the same output dimensionality as the input, allows for stacking multiple encoder blocks. The output of one block becomes the input to the next, enabling the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input sequence.


`<----------section---------->`

### Decoder

The Decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, using the contextualized representation generated by the encoder.  At each step, the decoder considers the encoder's output and the previously generated words in the output sequence.

The decoder block structure mirrors the encoder block, with the addition of a second multi-head attention mechanism, called encoder-decoder attention. This mechanism allows the decoder to attend to the relevant parts of the encoder's output when generating each word in the output sequence.

The original Transformer architecture used 6 decoder blocks. A key difference from the encoder's self-attention is the "masked" self-attention within the decoder. This mask prevents the decoder from attending to future positions in the output sequence during training, ensuring that predictions are made only based on the information available up to the current time step.

The final layer of the decoder is a linear layer followed by a softmax function.  This projects the decoder's output to the vocabulary size, producing a probability distribution over all possible words for the next position in the output sequence.


`<----------section---------->`

### Masked Multi-Head Attention

Masked Multi-Head Attention is crucial for training the decoder. During the generation of the *i*-th output word, the decoder should only consider the preceding words (positions 1 to *i-1*) and not "peek" into the future.  This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention scores, effectively setting the scores corresponding to future positions to negative infinity. This forces the softmax function to assign zero probability to these future positions.


`<----------section---------->`

### Encoder-Decoder Attention

Encoder-Decoder Attention bridges the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to leverage the contextualized information encoded by the encoder. In this mechanism, the queries come from the decoder, while the keys and values are derived from the encoder's output.  This allows the decoder to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the output sequence.


`<----------section---------->`

### Output

The final decoder output for each time step is a vector representing the generated word. This vector is fed through a linear layer, which is often tied (shared weights) with the input embedding matrix, and a softmax function to compute the probability distribution over the output vocabulary.  The word with the highest probability is then selected as the output for that time step.


`<----------section---------->`

### Transformer‚Äôs Pipeline

The Transformer processes sequential data through a distinct pipeline. First, the encoder processes the entire input sequence, generating a set of contextualized representations.  Next, the decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time.  At each step, the decoder receives the encoder's output and the previously generated words.  This process repeats until an end-of-sequence token is generated, signaling the completion of the output sequence.

The linked resource ([https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/)) provides an interactive visualization of the Transformer architecture, which can further aid understanding.

`<----------section---------->`

### Additional Context and Insights (Integrating Provided Context)


The Transformer architecture offers several advantages over traditional recurrent and convolutional models for sequence-to-sequence tasks. Key innovations include:

* **Self-Attention:**  This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each word, capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than recurrent networks, which struggle with vanishing gradients over long sequences.

* **Scalability:** The lack of recurrence and the parallelizable nature of attention computations allow Transformers to be scaled to much larger datasets and model sizes than RNNs or CNNs. This scalability has been instrumental in the development of large language models.

* **Stackability:** The consistent input and output dimensions of Transformer layers facilitate stacking multiple layers, enabling the model to learn increasingly complex representations of the input data.

* **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE):** While not part of the core Transformer architecture, BPE plays a critical role in handling large vocabularies efficiently by representing words as subword units.  This helps reduce the vocabulary size and addresses the out-of-vocabulary problem.

* **Positional Encodings:**  These encodings compensate for the lack of inherent positional information in self-attention, allowing the model to account for word order in the input sequence.

These innovations, combined with the ability to train on massive datasets, have led to significant performance improvements in various NLP tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and text generation. The Transformer‚Äôs ability to capture long-range dependencies and be trained efficiently has been particularly crucial for the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) which demonstrate impressive abilities in understanding and generating human-like text.

### Transformers for text representation and generation

Transformers have revolutionized NLP by offering a powerful architecture for both text representation and generation. Their flexibility allows for various configurations tailored to specific tasks:

* **Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT):** These models excel at text representation by processing the entire input sequence simultaneously, capturing contextual information from both preceding and following words. This bidirectional understanding makes them ideal for tasks like sentence classification, question answering, and named entity recognition.

* **Decoder-only models (e.g., GPT):** These models are specialized for text generation. They process the input sequence sequentially, predicting the next word based on the preceding context.  This autoregressive approach makes them suitable for tasks like text completion, translation, and summarization.

* **Seq2Seq models (Encoder-Decoder Architectures):** Combining encoder and decoder components, these models are well-suited for tasks requiring mapping input sequences to output sequences, such as machine translation. The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation.

### Paradigm Shift in NLP

The introduction of LLMs marked a significant paradigm shift in NLP, moving away from traditional methods and embracing new approaches:

**Before LLMs:**

* **Feature Engineering:** NLP pipelines heavily relied on manually crafted features, requiring domain expertise and significant effort.
* **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model architecture for each task was crucial and often involved extensive experimentation.
* **Transfer Learning:**  Transferring knowledge from one domain to another with limited labeled data was a common challenge.
* **Overfitting vs. Generalization:** Carefully balancing model complexity to prevent overfitting while ensuring good generalization was essential.

**Since LLMs:**

* **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** LLMs leverage vast amounts of unlabeled data during pre-training to learn general language representations.  Fine-tuning then adapts these representations to specific downstream tasks with smaller labeled datasets.
* **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning:** LLMs can perform tasks with limited or no task-specific training data, showcasing remarkable generalization abilities.
* **Prompting:**  Guiding LLMs to perform specific tasks by providing natural language instructions (prompts) has become a standard practice.
* **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding how LLMs arrive at their outputs remains a critical research area.

**What caused this shift?**

The limitations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly in handling long sequences due to vanishing gradients and sequential processing, paved the way for the Transformer architecture. The attention mechanism within Transformers addresses these limitations by:

* **Handling long-range dependencies:** Attention allows the model to consider relationships between words regardless of their distance in the sequence.
* **Enabling parallel training:** Unlike RNNs, the attention mechanism enables parallel processing of the input sequence, significantly reducing training time.
* **Calculating dynamic attention weights:** The attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights to different parts of the input sequence, focusing on the most relevant information for the given task.

<----------section---------->

### Pre-training of LLMs

**Self-supervised Pre-training:**

LLMs are pre-trained using self-supervised learning on massive text datasets, eliminating the need for extensive manual labeling:

* **Autoencoding models (e.g., Masked Language Modeling - MLM):**  These models, like BERT, are trained to predict masked words in a sentence based on the surrounding context. This fosters a bidirectional understanding of language.

* **Autoregressive models (e.g., Causal Language Modeling - CLM):** Models like GPT are trained to predict the next word in a sequence.  This unidirectional approach is well-suited for text generation.

* **Seq2seq models (e.g., Span Corruption):**  These models reconstruct corrupted sections of text, combining comprehension and generation capabilities.


The flexibility to combine different pre-training tasks contributes significantly to the versatility of LLMs, allowing them to develop a rich understanding of language applicable to various downstream tasks. This self-supervised approach enables learning from the inherent structure of language itself, developing a knowledge base readily adapted for specific applications, including zero-shot learning scenarios.


<----------section---------->

### Datasets and Data Pre-processing

**Datasets:**

Training LLMs requires enormous text corpora sourced from diverse sources:

* **Books:** BookCorpus, Project Gutenberg, and other collections provide a rich source of long-form text.
* **CommonCrawl:** This massive web archive provides a broad snapshot of the internet but requires extensive pre-processing due to its noisy nature.
* **Wikipedia:**  A reliable source of high-quality factual information available in numerous languages.
* **Other Sources:** Social media platforms (Reddit), code repositories (GitHub), news articles, and various other web sources contribute to the diversity of training data.

**Data Pre-processing:**

Pre-processing is essential to ensure data quality, model performance, and mitigate potential biases and harmful outputs:

* **Quality Filtering:** Removing low-quality, noisy, or irrelevant text using heuristics, regular expressions, or machine learning classifiers.
* **Deduplication:** Identifying and removing duplicate content to avoid overfitting and ensure balanced representation.
* **Privacy Scrubbing:** Removing personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data to protect user privacy.
* **Filtering Toxic and Biased Text:**  Identifying and mitigating potentially harmful or biased language to promote fairness and responsible AI.


<----------section---------->

### Using LLMs after Pre-training

After pre-training, LLMs can be adapted to specific downstream tasks through two primary methods:

**Fine-tuning:**

Fine-tuning adjusts the pre-trained model's weights using a smaller, task-specific dataset and gradient descent.  This can involve fine-tuning the entire model, specific layers (e.g., adding a classification head), or utilizing parameter-efficient methods like adapters.

**Prompting:**

Prompting involves crafting specific input instructions to guide the model's output without modifying its parameters. This enables a single pre-trained model to perform various tasks simply by changing the prompt, offering remarkable flexibility.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 13: Encoder-only Transformers**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of encoder-only transformer models, focusing on BERT and its applications in tasks like token classification and named entity recognition.  It explains the underlying architecture, pre-training methods, fine-tuning strategies, and various BERT variants.  The document also includes practical guidance on implementing these models using Hugging Face resources.

<----------section---------->

### Outline

* Encoder-only Transformers:  An architectural overview of transformers used for specific NLP tasks.
* BERT:  A detailed explanation of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model.
* Practice on Token Classification and Named Entity Recognition: Practical application of BERT for these tasks.

<----------section---------->

### Encoder-only Transformer

The transformer architecture, originally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, consists of both encoder and decoder components.  However, certain tasks don't require the full architecture.

* **Sequence-to-Sequence of the Same Length:**  When the input and output sequences have the same length, only the encoder is necessary.  The output vectors (ùëß‚ÇÅ, ..., ùëßùë°) are derived directly from the encoder, allowing for direct loss computation. Examples include part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition.

* **Sequence to Single Value:**  For tasks like sequence classification, where the output is a single value, the encoder is sufficient.  A special `[CLS]` token is prepended to the input sequence, and its corresponding output vector (ùëß‚ÇÅ) represents the entire sequence, used for computing the loss function.  Sentiment analysis is a typical example of such a task.

<----------section---------->

### BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Google in 2018, is a powerful language model leveraging the encoder part of the transformer architecture. It comes in different sizes, with BERT-base (12 encoder blocks, 110M parameters) and BERT-large (24 encoder blocks, 340M parameters) being the most common. BERT's key strength lies in its ability to understand bidirectional context, meaning it considers both preceding and succeeding words to understand the meaning of a word within a sentence. This is a significant advancement over traditional unidirectional language models.  BERT is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.

<----------section---------->

### BERT Input Encoding

BERT employs the WordPiece tokenizer, a subword tokenization method, to process input text.

* **Subword Tokenization:** WordPiece breaks words into smaller units (subwords), allowing BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words and efficiently represent a wide range of vocabulary with a smaller vocabulary size.  Common words are treated as single tokens, while rarer words are split into constituent subwords.

* **Vocabulary:**  WordPiece constructs a vocabulary of common words and subwords. For instance, "unhappiness" could be tokenized into "un," "happy," and "##ness," where "##" signifies a subword continuing a previous word.

* **Special Tokens:** BERT utilizes specific tokens: `[CLS]` at the beginning of each sequence for classification tasks and `[SEP]` to separate sentences within a sequence or mark the end of a single sentence.

* **Token IDs:**  Each token is converted into a numerical ID corresponding to its position in the BERT vocabulary, which serves as the input to the model.

**Advantages of WordPiece Embedding:**

* **Handles Unseen Words:**  Facilitates the representation of rare or unknown words by breaking them into known subwords.
* **Reduced Vocabulary Size:** Improves computational efficiency compared to character-level models.
* **Captures Morphology:**  Helps capture morphological information by representing words through their subword components.


<----------section---------->

### BERT [CLS] Token

The `[CLS]` token, prepended to every input sequence, serves as an aggregate representation of the entire sequence.  After processing the input, BERT's final hidden state corresponding to the `[CLS]` token captures the overall meaning and context of the sequence. This embedding is used for downstream tasks like classification.

* **Single-Sentence Classification:**  The `[CLS]` embedding is directly fed into a classifier for tasks like sentiment analysis.

* **Sentence-Pair Tasks:**  For tasks involving two sentences (e.g., question answering, paraphrase detection), the `[CLS]` embedding represents the relationship between the two sentences.

<----------section---------->

### BERT Pre-training

BERT's pre-training involves two unsupervised tasks:

* **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Randomly masking a percentage of input tokens (usually 15%) and training the model to predict these masked tokens based on the surrounding context. This bidirectional training approach enables BERT to learn deep contextual representations.  Variations in masking strategies, such as dynamic masking where the masked tokens change during training epochs, further improve the robustness of the learned representations.

* **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Training the model to predict whether two given sentences are consecutive in the original text. Although its effectiveness has been debated, and some subsequent models like RoBERTa have omitted it, it aims to teach the model about inter-sentence relationships.

These pre-training tasks utilize a massive text corpus (BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia), exposing the model to a diverse range of language structures and semantics.

<----------section---------->

### BERT Fine-tuning

After pre-training, BERT is fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks by adding task-specific layers on top of the encoder output.  The pre-trained weights can be either frozen or further updated during fine-tuning. The process involves minimizing the cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual labels for the given task.  Fine-tuning allows adapting BERT's general language understanding to specific application domains.  The `[CLS]` token's representation is crucial during fine-tuning as it gets specifically trained to capture the nuances required for the target task.


**Example Tasks:**

* **Text Classification:** Sentiment analysis, topic categorization, spam detection.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities like persons, organizations, and locations within text.
* **Question Answering:**  Extractive question answering, where the model identifies the answer span within a given text passage.

<----------section---------->


### BERT Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**

* **Bidirectional Contextual Understanding:**  Captures rich contextual information from both left and right, significantly improving language understanding.
* **Transfer Learning:**  Pre-training on large datasets allows for effective transfer learning to various downstream tasks, reducing the need for extensive task-specific data.
* **State-of-the-art Performance:**  Achieves excellent results on various NLP benchmarks.

**Limitations:**

* **Computational Resources:** Requires substantial computational resources for pre-training and fine-tuning, especially for larger models.
* **Memory Requirements:**  Large model size can pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
* **Data Dependency:**  While transfer learning reduces data requirements, fine-tuning still needs labeled data, which can be expensive to acquire.


<----------section---------->

### Popular BERT Variants

Several BERT variants have been developed to address its limitations and improve performance:

* **RoBERTa:** Improved training methodology, larger datasets, removal of NSP task.
* **ALBERT:** Parameter reduction techniques for efficiency.
* **DistilBERT:** Knowledge distillation for smaller model size and faster inference.
* **TinyBERT:**  Even smaller and faster than DistilBERT, optimized for resource-constrained environments.
* **ELECTRA:**  More efficient pre-training using a replaced token detection task.
* **Domain-Specific Variants:** SciBERT (scientific text), BioBERT (biomedical text), ClinicalBERT (clinical notes).
* **Multilingual BERT (mBERT):** Supports multiple languages.
* **Other Language-Specific Variants:** CamemBERT (French), FinBERT (financial), LegalBERT (legal).

BERT's influence extends beyond NLP, inspiring transformer-based models in computer vision, such as Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, and Masked Auto Encoders (MAE).

<----------section---------->

### Practice on Token Classification and Named Entity Recognition

The provided Hugging Face tutorial (https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/2?fw=pt) offers practical guidance on using BERT for token classification and named entity recognition.  It recommends exploring different BERT versions, testing with custom prompts and public datasets like CoNLL-2003 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/eriktks/conll2003), and fine-tuning lightweight BERT versions when resources permit. This hands-on approach allows for practical experience with BERT's application in these crucial NLP tasks.  Experimenting with different models, datasets, and fine-tuning strategies will provide a deeper understanding of BERT's capabilities and limitations.  The Hugging Face ecosystem simplifies the process of leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 14: Decoder-only Transformers**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of decoder-only transformers, focusing on their architecture, applications, and prominent examples like GPT and LLaMA.  It explores the underlying mechanisms of text generation, training processes, and the advantages and limitations of these models.  Furthermore, it delves into specific details such as input encoding techniques and the evolution of different GPT versions, offering a comparative analysis between LLAMA and GPT.

<----------section---------->

### Outline

* Decoder-only transformer
* GPT
* LLAMA
* Practice on text generation

<----------section---------->

### Decoder-only Transformer

Decoder-only transformers, unlike the original transformer architecture which uses both encoder and decoder components, utilize only the decoder part. This architectural choice makes them particularly well-suited for autoregressive tasks, specifically text generation.  The absence of separate encoder layers simplifies the model and streamlines the process of generating text sequentially.  Tasks such as summarization and question answering, where the output is generated conditionally based on an input prompt, also benefit from this streamlined architecture.  Examples of successful decoder-only transformers include the GPT series and LLaMA.

The core principle behind text generation in decoder-only transformers is autoregression. This means generating text token by token, where each new token is predicted based on the preceding tokens in the sequence.  The input prompt and the generated text are treated as a single continuous sequence, enabling the model to implicitly "encode" the prompt's meaning while simultaneously "decoding" it into generated text. This unified approach eliminates the need for a separate encoder block.

The self-attention mechanism within decoder layers is crucial for context building.  However, a causal (unidirectional or forward) mask is applied to ensure that each token attends only to previous tokens, mimicking the natural flow of language generation.  This prevents the model from "looking ahead" at future tokens during training and generation.  This sequential processing allows the model to accumulate contextual information and learn complex relationships between tokens, effectively replacing the need for explicit encoder-decoder attention.

<----------section---------->

### Encoder-only vs. Decoder-only

| Feature          | Encoder-Only Transformers (e.g., BERT)                       | Decoder-Only Transformers (e.g., GPT)                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Architecture     | Only encoder blocks. Employs bidirectional self-attention, processing the entire input sequence simultaneously to capture context from both directions.                 | Only decoder blocks. Employs causal (unidirectional) self-attention, processing tokens sequentially from left to right, conditioning each prediction on previous tokens. |
| Training Objective | Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Randomly masks tokens in the input and trains the model to predict the masked tokens based on surrounding context.                               | Autoregressive Language Modeling. Trains the model to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding tokens.                          |
| Context         | Processes entire sequence in parallel, allowing for rich contextual understanding.                         | Processes tokens sequentially (one by one), building up context as it progresses.                    |
| Main Use Cases  | Primarily suited for tasks requiring understanding of the entire input sequence, such as text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and question answering.                   | Ideal for generative tasks like text generation, story generation, code generation, and translation.           |
| Attention Type   | Bidirectional self-attention.                                 | Unidirectional (masked) self-attention.                       |
| Output          | Typically generates contextualized embeddings for each input token, which can then be used for downstream tasks.                 | Produces sequential token generation (text or other content).          |


<----------section---------->

### Decoder-only Transformer Applications

The versatility of decoder-only transformers allows them to be applied to a wide range of tasks:

* **Text Generation:** Creating various forms of textual content, ranging from news articles and stories to creative writing and poetry.

* **Summarization:** Condensing lengthy documents into concise summaries while retaining key information and overall meaning.
* **Translation:**  Generating translations between different languages by treating it as a text generation task conditioned on the source language input.


<----------section---------->

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

GPT, developed by OpenAI, represents a prominent family of decoder-only transformers. These models are pre-trained on vast text datasets to learn the nuances of language and generate human-like text.  This pre-training enables them to perform various natural language tasks with remarkable proficiency, even without task-specific training.

* **GPT-1 (2018):** The initial iteration of GPT, showcasing the potential of the decoder-only architecture. It had 117 million parameters, distributed across 12 decoder blocks with 768-dimensional embeddings and 12 attention heads per block.
* **GPT-2 (2019):** A significantly larger model, with the XL version boasting 1.5 billion parameters. This version comprised 48 decoder blocks with 1600-dimensional embeddings and 25 attention heads per block, enabling it to generate more coherent and lengthy text.

* **GPT-4 (2023):** The latest iteration introduced multi-modal capabilities, processing both image and text inputs. It also showcased enhanced reasoning and broader general knowledge. Detailed architectural information is not publicly available.


<----------section---------->

### GPT Input Encoding

GPT models employ Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization. BPE represents a subword tokenization technique that balances word-level and character-level representations. It breaks down words into smaller, meaningful sub-units (tokens) based on their frequency in the training data.  This approach allows for a more efficient representation of both common and infrequent words, handling out-of-vocabulary words gracefully by decomposing them into known subwords.  The vocabulary size varies depending on the GPT version, with GPT-2 utilizing around 50,000 tokens.


**Key Advantages of BPE:**

* **Handles morphology and new words effectively:** By breaking down complex words into subword units, BPE effectively handles morphological variations and adapts to new or unseen words.
* **Reduced vocabulary size:** Compared to character-level tokenization, BPE results in a smaller vocabulary, making training more efficient.
* **Robust out-of-vocabulary handling:**  BPE's ability to decompose unknown words into subwords or characters provides resilience against out-of-vocabulary scenarios.


<----------section---------->

### GPT Pre-training

GPT models are pre-trained using a next-token prediction objective, also known as autoregressive language modeling.  This training strategy involves predicting the next word (or token) in a sequence, effectively learning contextual relationships and linguistic patterns. The prediction is sequential, proceeding from left to right.  The training process utilizes massive and diverse datasets derived from internet text, allowing the model to absorb a wide range of linguistic structures and topical information.  GPT-1 was trained on BookCorpus, while subsequent versions like GPT-2 and GPT-3 utilized larger datasets like WebText and a combination of sources including Common Crawl, Books, and Wikipedia.  Training involves minimizing cross-entropy loss using optimizers like Adam, incorporating techniques like learning rate schedules (warm-up and decay) and large batch sizes to enhance training stability and generalization.


<----------section---------->

### GPT Fine-tuning

While pre-training lays the foundation for general language understanding, fine-tuning allows tailoring GPT models for specific tasks. This involves training the model on a smaller, labeled dataset curated for the target application.  Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained knowledge to the specific nuances of the downstream task, leading to improved performance.

**Examples of fine-tuning tasks:**

* Customer Support Automation
* Medical Assistance
* Legal Document Processing
* Coding Assistance
* Educational Tutoring
* Content Creation
* Virtual Personal Assistants


<----------section---------->

### GPT Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**

* **Sensitivity to Prompting:** The quality of generated text is heavily dependent on the input prompt.  Carefully crafted prompts are crucial for eliciting desired responses.
* **Ethical and Bias Concerns:**  Trained on internet data, GPT models can inherit and amplify biases present in the training data, potentially leading to harmful or discriminatory outputs.
* **Limited Reasoning and Calculation:** GPT models struggle with complex reasoning tasks and mathematical calculations, often resorting to approximations or generating incorrect answers.
* **High Computational Requirements:**  Training and deploying large GPT models demand significant computational resources, limiting accessibility for researchers and developers with limited access to powerful hardware.
* **Limited Memory Across Interactions:**  GPT models typically lack memory of past interactions, treating each conversation or prompt as a separate instance.


<----------section---------->

### Popular GPT Variants

### LLAMA Input Encoding

Similar to GPT, LLaMA utilizes Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, with a vocabulary size of 32,768 tokens. However, LLaMA employs relative positional encodings, in contrast to the absolute positional encodings used in some other transformer models. Relative positional encodings offer advantages in handling variable sequence lengths and improving generalization across different contexts.

<----------section---------->

### LLAMA Pre-training

LLaMA follows a similar pre-training approach to GPT, using autoregressive language modeling (next-token prediction) as its training objective. It is trained on "The Pile," a massive dataset comprising diverse public text sources like books, web data, and scientific papers. The training process involves minimizing cross-entropy loss, typically using optimizers like SGD or Adam with gradient clipping and other optimization techniques such as mixed precision training, learning rate schedules, and weight decay.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 15: Encoder-Decoder Transformers**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This lesson explores the architecture and functionality of Encoder-Decoder Transformers, focusing on the T5 model and its application in sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation and summarization.  We will delve into the model's structure, training process, and various adaptations for specific tasks.  Finally, we'll provide resources for hands-on practice with these models.

<----------section---------->

### Outline

* Encoder-decoder transformer architecture
* T5 model and its variants
* Practical applications: Translation and Summarization

<----------section---------->

### Encoder-Decoder Transformer Architecture

Encoder-Decoder Transformers are a powerful class of neural networks specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) tasks, where the input is a sequence of tokens (e.g., words in a sentence) and the output is another sequence of tokens, potentially in a different language or format.  They leverage the attention mechanism to capture dependencies between input and output sequences, enabling effective handling of long-range dependencies and contextual information. This architecture contrasts with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process sequences sequentially and can struggle with long-range dependencies.

The encoder processes the input sequence, transforming it into a set of hidden representations that capture the meaning and context of the input. The decoder then takes these representations and generates the output sequence, one token at a time, while attending to relevant parts of the encoded input. This attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input when generating each output token, leading to improved performance, especially in tasks like machine translation.

<----------section---------->

### T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a prominent language model developed by Google Research, based on the encoder-decoder transformer architecture.  Its defining characteristic is the framing of all tasks as text-to-text problems, simplifying training and fine-tuning for diverse applications.  T5 is available in various sizes, catering to different computational resource limitations:

| T5 Version | Encoder Blocks | Heads | Decoder Blocks | Embedding Dimensionality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T5-Small | 6 | 8 | 6 | 512 |
| T5-Base | 12 | 12 | 12 | 768 |
| T5-Large | 24 | 16 | 24 | 1024 |
| T5-XL | 24 | 32 | 24 | 2048 |
| T5-XXL | 24 | 64 | 24 | 4096 |

The number of encoder and decoder blocks, attention heads, and embedding dimensionality directly influence the model's capacity and performance. Larger models generally perform better but require significantly more computational resources for training and inference.

<----------section---------->

### T5 Input Encoding

T5 utilizes a SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000 tokens.  SentencePiece is a subword tokenizer that creates a balance between character and word-level tokenization, efficiently handling rare words and out-of-vocabulary terms. This is achieved through the use of a unigram language model that selects subwords to maximize the likelihood of the training data. This approach allows for a more compact vocabulary while still capturing a rich representation of the language.


* **Subword Units:**  Breaking words into subword units allows the model to handle unseen words by combining known subwords.
* **Unigram Language Model:** The unigram language model used for training the tokenizer ensures that frequent subwords are prioritized, optimizing the vocabulary for efficiency.
* **Special Tokens:** T5 incorporates special tokens to guide the model:
    * `<pad>`:  Pads sequences to a uniform length within a batch.
    * `<unk>`: Represents unknown tokens.
    * `<eos>`: Signals the end of a sequence.
    * `<sep>` and task-specific prefixes: Define the task type (e.g., "translate English to German:", "summarize:").  These prefixes guide the model towards the desired output format.


<----------section---------->

### T5 Pre-training

T5's pre-training employs a denoising autoencoder objective called span corruption.  This involves masking random spans of text within the input and training the model to reconstruct the original text.

* **Span Corruption:**  Instead of masking individual tokens, T5 masks entire spans of text, encouraging the model to learn contextual relationships and generate more coherent output.  This differs from masked language modeling (MLM) used in models like BERT, which masks individual tokens.
* **Example:**
    * **Original Input:** "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    * **Corrupted Input:** "The quick `<extra_id_0>` jumps `<extra_id_1>` dog."
    * **Target Output:** `<extra_id_0>` brown fox `<extra_id_1>` over the lazy.
* **C4 Dataset:**  T5's pre-training leverages the C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) dataset, a massive and diverse text corpus derived from Common Crawl.  Its large size and diversity contribute to the model's robust performance across various domains.
* **Training Details:**
    * **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss measures the difference between predicted and actual masked spans.
    * **Optimizer:** Adafactor, a memory-efficient optimizer designed for large-scale training, is used to update the model's parameters.
    * **Learning Rate Scheduling:** A warm-up phase followed by inverse square root decay adjusts the learning rate throughout training. This strategy helps the model converge efficiently and avoid getting stuck in local minima.

<----------section---------->

### T5 Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained T5 model for specific downstream tasks.  The text-to-text paradigm is maintained, with task-specific prefixes guiding the model.

* **Text-to-Text Paradigm:**  All inputs and outputs are treated as text strings, simplifying the adaptation process.
* **Example Tasks and Prefixes:**
    * **Summarization:** `summarize: <document>` ‚Üí `<summary>`
    * **Translation:** `translate English to French: <text>` ‚Üí `<translated_text>`
    * **Question Answering:** `question: <question> context: <context>` ‚Üí `<answer>`

<----------section---------->

### Popular T5 Variants

Several T5 variants have been developed for specific purposes and improvements:

| Variant | Purpose | Key Strengths | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| mT5 | Multilingual NLP | Supports 101 languages | Performance can vary across languages |
| Flan-T5 | Instruction-following | Generalizes well to new instructions |  Requires carefully crafted task-specific prompts |
| ByT5 | No tokenization | Handles noisy and unstructured text well | Slower due to byte-level processing |
| T5-3B/11B | High-capacity NLP | Excellent performance on complex tasks | Requires substantial computational resources |
| UL2 | Unified objectives | Versatile across different tasks | Increased training complexity |
| Multimodal T5 | Vision-language tasks | Processes both text and image inputs | Computationally intensive |
| Efficient T5 | Resource-constrained NLP | Lightweight and fast inference |  Performance trade-off compared to larger models |

These variants showcase the adaptability of the T5 architecture to diverse NLP tasks and resource constraints.

### Enhanced Text: Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models Final Project Guidelines

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 16: Final Project**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for the final project of the NLP and LLM 2024/2025 course. The project involves designing and implementing a chatbot specialized in answering questions about the course content and related information, while effectively handling out-of-context queries. This document outlines the project goals, approved tools, and the evaluation procedure.


<----------section---------->

**Project Goal**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a chatbot capable of accurately and comprehensively answering questions pertaining to the NLP and LLM 2024/2025 course. This includes questions about the course material, schedule, assignments, instructors, recommended resources, and other relevant administrative details.  Crucially, the chatbot should demonstrate the ability to discern questions outside the course's scope and respond appropriately, indicating its inability to address unrelated topics.  This requires implementing a robust context recognition mechanism.  Deliverables for this project include the complete chatbot code and a detailed report explaining the design choices, implemented methodologies, and justification for the chosen tools and technologies.

<----------section---------->

**Permitted Tools and Technologies**

Students are granted the freedom to utilize any tools and technologies discussed during the course. This encompasses both modern Large Language Model (LLM) based approaches and traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  A hybrid approach, combining LLMs for certain functionalities and classic NLP methods for others, is encouraged.  The rationale behind the chosen combination should be clearly articulated in the final report.  Pre-existing LLMs and other models can be incorporated, either directly or with modifications. However, groups must possess a thorough understanding of the chosen tools and models, demonstrating the ability to explain their workings, limitations, and integration within the chatbot's architecture. This includes a deep familiarity with the codebase and the underlying model's functionalities.

<----------section---------->

**Chatbot Evaluation Procedure**

The evaluation process will consist of two phases, both conducted by the course instructors before the project discussion.  In the first phase, the chatbot will be assessed in real-time using a pre-determined set of questions related to the course content.  The evaluation criteria for this phase are:

* **Relevance:**  Does the chatbot provide an answer directly addressing the specific query? This assesses the chatbot's ability to understand the question's intent and retrieve the correct information.

* **Fluency:** Is the generated response grammatically correct, well-structured, and easy to understand? This evaluates the quality of the language used by the chatbot.

* **Coherence:** Does the response exhibit a logical flow and internal consistency? This examines the overall structure and organization of the answer.

In the second phase, a different set of pre-defined questions will be used to evaluate the following aspects:

* **Robustness:** Can the chatbot handle adversarial or misleading prompts designed to test its resilience and ability to maintain context?  Examples include questions like "Are you sure?"  This evaluates the chatbot's ability to handle challenging inputs.

* **Precision:**  How accurately does the chatbot identify and handle out-of-context questions?  Examples include questions like "Who is the king of Spain?"  This assesses the chatbot's ability to stay within the defined scope.


The final project grade will be based on the chatbot's performance across all these evaluation criteria.  The detailed report will also be considered in the overall assessment.  The instructors will provide specific grading rubrics and weighting for each evaluation aspect before the project commencement.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 17: Fine-Tuning**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of fine-tuning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), covering various methods from full fine-tuning to parameter-efficient strategies and instruction fine-tuning.  It explains the rationale behind fine-tuning, its benefits, and the challenges associated with different approaches.

<----------section---------->

### Outline

* Types of Fine-Tuning
* Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
* Instruction Fine-Tuning

<----------section---------->

### Types of Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning tailors a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain by further training it on a dataset relevant to the target application.  This process allows the model to specialize its knowledge and improve its performance on the downstream task.

**Why Fine-Tune?**

* **Domain Specialization:**  Pre-trained LLMs possess broad knowledge but may lack expertise in specific areas. Fine-tuning allows them to acquire specialized knowledge relevant to a particular domain, such as medical, legal, or financial.
* **Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance:** Fine-tuning improves the accuracy and relevance of LLM outputs for specific applications.  A model fine-tuned for medical diagnosis will generate more accurate and relevant responses to medical queries than a general-purpose model.
* **Effective Utilization of Smaller Datasets:** Fine-tuning enables LLMs to achieve good performance even with smaller, focused datasets, which are often easier to curate than massive general-purpose datasets.

**Full Fine-Tuning:**

This method involves updating all the parameters of the pre-trained LLM. While it can lead to high accuracy on the target task, it has significant drawbacks:

* **Computational Cost:**  Updating all parameters requires substantial computational resources and training time, making it impractical for many users and applications.
* **Overfitting Risk:** With small datasets, full fine-tuning can lead to overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

**Other Types of Fine-Tuning:**

Several alternative fine-tuning strategies address the limitations of full fine-tuning by updating only a subset of the model's parameters:

* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** This category encompasses techniques like LoRA, Adapters, and Prefix-Tuning, which offer a balance between performance and efficiency.
* **Instruction Fine-Tuning:** This approach focuses on aligning the LLM with specific instructions or prompts, making it more responsive and adaptable to diverse user queries.
* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):**  RLHF combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to train LLMs to generate outputs that align with human preferences and values.  This method is crucial for developing chatbots and other interactive AI applications.

<----------section---------->

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

PEFT methods significantly reduce the computational and storage burden associated with full fine-tuning by modifying only a small fraction of the model's parameters.  This makes fine-tuning large LLMs feasible for resource-constrained environments and applications requiring frequent model updates. Popular PEFT methods are implemented in libraries like Hugging Face Transformers and `peft`.

**PEFT Techniques:**

* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** LoRA injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer model, allowing efficient fine-tuning with minimal parameter updates.
* **Adapters:** These small, task-specific modules are inserted within the Transformer layers, enabling fine-tuning without modifying the original model weights.  Adapters are particularly useful for multi-task learning, where a single model can be adapted to various tasks by switching between different adapter modules.
* **Prefix Tuning:**  This method prepends a sequence of trainable prefix tokens to the input sequence, influencing the model's attention mechanism and guiding its output generation without altering the original weights.


<----------section---------->

### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)

LoRA operates on the principle that the changes needed to adapt a pre-trained model to a new task can be effectively captured by a low-rank representation.  This allows for substantial parameter savings while maintaining performance.

1. **Base Model Weights (W):** The pre-trained transformer model is characterized by its weight matrices *W*.
2. **Low-Rank Decomposition (ŒîW = A √ó B):**  Instead of directly modifying *W*, LoRA learns a low-rank decomposition of the weight update Œî*W*. This update is represented as the product of two low-rank matrices, *A* (m√ór) and *B* (r√ón), where *r* is the rank, significantly smaller than the dimensions *m* and *n* of *W*.
3. **Weight Update (W' = W + ŒîW):** During fine-tuning, the effective weight matrix *W'* is computed as the sum of the original weights *W* and the low-rank update Œî*W*.

**How LoRA Works:**

* **Frozen Pre-trained Weights:**  The original weights *W* remain frozen, preserving the general knowledge acquired during pre-training.
* **Task-Specific Knowledge Injection:** The low-rank matrices *A* and *B* encode the task-specific knowledge, requiring significantly fewer parameters than updating the full weight matrix.
* **Parameter Efficiency:** The number of trainable parameters is dramatically reduced, making LoRA highly efficient.
* **Inference Compatibility:** During inference, the low-rank update can be efficiently applied to the frozen weights, ensuring fast and memory-efficient deployment.


<----------section---------->

### Adapters

Adapters are small, pluggable modules integrated within the Transformer architecture. They introduce task-specific parameters while keeping the original model parameters frozen, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency.  Adapters are trained to learn task-specific representations, while the pre-trained model provides a robust and general foundation.  This modularity also facilitates multi-task learning.

<----------section---------->

### Prefix Tuning

Prefix Tuning optimizes a small set of continuous prefix vectors that are prepended to the input sequence. These prefixes guide the model's attention mechanism, allowing it to adapt to different tasks without modifying the underlying model weights.  This approach is highly parameter-efficient, as only the prefix vectors are trained. The length of the prefix sequence controls the trade-off between task-specific expressiveness and parameter efficiency.

<----------section---------->

### Instruction Fine-Tuning

Instruction fine-tuning enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and respond to user instructions by training them on a dataset of (instruction, input, output) triples.  This process improves the model's ability to generalize to new instructions and generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

**How Instruction Fine-Tuning Works:**

The training dataset consists of examples comprising:

* **Instruction:**  A human-readable prompt specifying the desired task.
* **Context (Optional):** Relevant background information or data.
* **Output:** The desired response to the given instruction and context.

By training on a diverse range of instruction-response pairs, the LLM learns to interpret user intent and generate appropriate outputs, improving its usability in real-world applications.  The diversity of the training data is crucial for robust generalization.

<----------section---------->

**Additional context** provided in the original text regarding BERT pre-training, fine-tuning, implementation details, and discussion of other NLP concepts and challenges are relevant to the broader context of LLMs and their applications.  They highlight the advancements and challenges in the field and offer valuable insights into the practical aspects of working with large language models. However,  they are tangential to the core topic of this lesson - fine-tuning -  and have been omitted from this enhanced text for improved focus and coherence.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 18: Prompt Engineering**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering, a crucial aspect of effectively utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs).  It covers fundamental concepts, techniques, and considerations for crafting effective prompts to achieve desired outcomes across various NLP tasks.

<----------section---------->

### Outline

* Introduction to Prompt Engineering
* Prompt Engineering Techniques
* Prompt Testing

This outline structures the lesson into three key parts: introducing the concept of prompt engineering, delving into specific techniques, and finally addressing the importance of testing and iterating on prompts.

<----------section---------->

### Introduction to Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is a relatively new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use LLMs for diverse applications and research areas.  It bridges the gap between human intention and machine interpretation, allowing users to effectively leverage the power of LLMs.  This involves understanding how to instruct LLMs in a way that elicits the desired response, accounting for their capabilities and limitations.

**Goals:**

* Enhance understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs. This includes recognizing their strengths in tasks like text generation and summarization, as well as their weaknesses, such as potential biases and factual inaccuracies.
* Improve LLM performance on a broad range of tasks (e.g., question answering, arithmetic reasoning).  By carefully structuring prompts, we can guide LLMs toward more accurate and relevant responses.
* Help interfacing with LLMs and integrating with other tools.  Prompt engineering facilitates seamless integration with other software and systems, expanding the potential applications of LLMs.
* Enable new capabilities, such as augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external resources.  Through techniques like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), prompts can incorporate external information, enhancing the LLM's knowledge base and enabling more informed responses.

<----------section---------->

### Writing Good Prompts

Crafting effective prompts is crucial for successful LLM interaction. The following guidelines provide practical advice for writing prompts that elicit desired outputs:

* Start with simple prompts, adding elements gradually while iterating and refining to improve results.  This iterative approach allows for incremental improvement and avoids overwhelming the model with excessive complexity.
* Use clear, specific instructions (e.g., "Write," "Classify," "Summarize") at the beginning of prompts.  Explicitly stating the desired task helps the LLM understand the intended action.
* Be detailed and descriptive to achieve better outcomes.  Providing sufficient context and specifying the desired format or length enhances the clarity of the prompt.
* Consider using examples to guide the model‚Äôs output.  Few-shot learning, where examples are provided within the prompt, can significantly improve the model's performance on specific tasks.
* Balance detail and length carefully, as excessive information can reduce effectiveness, and experiment to find the ideal format.  Finding the right balance between conciseness and providing sufficient context is essential for optimal prompt performance.

**Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the difference between ineffective and effective prompts:

* **Bad Prompt:** "Summarize this article."  Lacks specificity regarding desired length or focus.
* **Good Prompt:** "Generate a 100-word summary of this research article, focusing on the main findings." Clearly specifies the desired length and focus.

* **Bad Prompt:** "Write an apology email to a client."  Lacks context regarding the reason for the apology.
* **Good Prompt:** "Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delayed shipment, offering a discount, and providing an updated delivery estimate." Provides specific details and instructions.

* **Bad Prompt:** "Make this explanation easier to understand." Lacks target audience information.
* **Good Prompt:** "Rewrite this technical explanation in simpler language suitable for high school students." Specifies the target audience and desired simplification.

* **Bad Prompt:** "Classify the following review." Lacks classification categories.
* **Good Prompt:** "Classify the following review as positive, neutral, or negative." Provides specific classification categories.

* **Bad Prompt:** "Tell me about exercise benefits."  Lacks specificity and limits on the response.
* **Good Prompt:** "List five health benefits of regular exercise, each with a short explanation of how it improves well-being." Specifies the desired number of benefits and explanation.

* **Bad Prompt:** "Translate this sentence to French." Lacks information about tone or style.
* **Good Prompt:** "Translate the following English sentence into French, preserving the formal tone."  Specifies the desired tone for the translation.

<----------section---------->

### Elements of a Prompt

A well-structured prompt typically comprises the following elements:

* **Instruction:** A specific task or instruction you want the model to perform. This clearly directs the LLM towards the desired action.
* **Context:** External information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses.  Providing background information or relevant details helps the LLM generate more informed and relevant outputs.
* **Input Data:** The input or question that we are interested in finding a response for.  This is the data upon which the LLM will operate.
* **Output Indicator:** The type or format of the output.  Specifying the desired output format, such as a list, paragraph, or code snippet, helps structure the LLM's response.

**Example 1:**

* **Instruction:** Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive.
* **Input Data:** Text: I think the vacation is okay.
* **Output Indicator:** Sentiment:

**Example 2:**

* **Instruction:** Answer the question based on the context below. Keep the answer short and concise. Respond "Unsure about answer" if not sure.
* **Context:** Teplizumab traces its roots to a New Jersey drug company called Ortho Pharmaceutical. There, scientists generated an early version of the antibody, dubbed OKT3. Originally sourced from mice, the molecule was able to bind to the surface of T cells and limit their cell-killing potential. In 1986, it was approved to help prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, making it the first therapeutic antibody allowed for human use.
* **Input Data:** Question: What was OKT3 originally sourced from?

### In-Context Learning

In-context learning is a powerful capability of LLMs where they learn to perform a task by interpreting and leveraging information provided directly within the prompt, without requiring updates to their internal parameters. This eliminates the need for extensive retraining and allows for rapid adaptation to new tasks.

A prompt context for in-context learning may specify:

* **Reference Material:** Specific text or data to be used to perform the task. This provides the LLM with the necessary information to answer questions or generate relevant content.
* **Input-Output Pairs:** Examples of the task to illustrate the desired pattern.  Demonstrating the expected input-output relationship guides the LLM towards the correct behavior.
* **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Detailed guidance for completing the task.  Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps helps the LLM follow the desired process.
* **Clarifications:** Addressing potential ambiguities in the task.  Removing any ambiguity ensures that the LLM correctly interprets the intended meaning.
* **Templates:** Structures or placeholders to be filled in.  Templates provide a framework for the LLM's response, ensuring consistent formatting and structure.

Prompt engineering heavily leverages in-context learning to efficiently guide LLMs towards desired behaviors without requiring retraining.


<----------section---------->

### Prompts and NLP Tasks

Prompts can be designed to achieve various NLP tasks, showcasing the versatility of LLMs:

* **Text Summarization:** Condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries. (Examples provided in the "Writing Good Prompts" section)
* **Information Extraction:**  Retrieving specific information from a given text. (Examples provided in the "Writing Good Prompts" section)
* **Question Answering:** Providing answers to questions based on given context or knowledge. (Examples provided in the "Elements of a Prompt" section)
* **Text Classification:** Categorizing text into predefined categories. (Examples provided in the "Writing Good Prompts" section)
* **Code Generation:**  Generating code in various programming languages based on natural language descriptions. (Mentioned in the "Additional Context" as a capability of LLMs)
* **Reasoning:**  Performing logical deductions and inferences. (Discussed in the "Additional Context" as a challenging area for LLMs, requiring careful prompt design and potentially external tools)


<----------section---------->

### System Prompts

System prompts are instructions provided to the AI model *before* any user interactions. They establish the initial context and desired behavior for the LLM, shaping its subsequent responses.  This differs from user prompts, which are provided during the interaction.

System prompts can:

* Establish the assistant's behavior, context, tone, and any special instructions. This sets the overall persona and style of the LLM's responses.
* Guide the model on how to respond and what it should focus on. This can include specifying the desired level of detail, formality, or creativity.

**Examples:**

* "You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant who answers questions accurately and concisely."  This promotes helpful and concise responses.
* "You are an IT support assistant specializing in troubleshooting software and hardware issues. Respond politely and guide users through step-by-step solutions."  This establishes a specific persona and response style for IT support.
* "You are a friendly and engaging AI who responds in a warm and conversational tone, keeping responses lighthearted and approachable." This encourages a casual and friendly conversational style.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 2: Representing Text**

*Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco*

*DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno*


This lesson explores fundamental concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on representing text in a format computers can understand. We will cover tokenization, bag-of-words representation, token normalization techniques, stemming and lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and introduce the spaCy library.


<----------section---------->

### Outline

1. Tokenization:  Breaking down text into individual units.
2. Bag of Words Representation:  Representing text as a collection of words and their frequencies.
3. Token Normalization: Cleaning and standardizing tokens.
4. Stemming and Lemmatization:  Reducing words to their root forms.
5. Part of Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical labels to tokens.
6. Introducing spaCy:  An overview of a powerful NLP library in Python.


<----------section---------->

### Tokenization

**Preparing the Environment**

Jupyter notebooks (installable through `pip install jupyter` and the Jupyter extension for VS Code) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) are recommended for the exercises.  A virtual environment (`python -m venv .env` and `source .env/bin/activate`) is good practice for managing dependencies.  The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are required (`pip install numpy pandas`).

**Text Segmentation**

Text segmentation divides text into meaningful units at different levels:

* **Paragraph Segmentation:** Dividing a document into paragraphs.  This often relies on visual cues like line breaks or indentation.
* **Sentence Segmentation:**  Splitting paragraphs into sentences. This typically uses punctuation like periods, question marks, and exclamation points.
* **Word Segmentation:** Separating sentences into individual words.  This can be complex due to punctuation, contractions, and language-specific rules.

Tokenization is a specialized form of text segmentation, breaking text into units called tokens.

**What is a Token?**

A token is the smallest meaningful unit of text considered by an NLP system. Examples include:

* **Words:** "The," "quick," "brown," "fox."
* **Punctuation Marks:** ".", ",", "!", "?". These can be important for disambiguation and understanding sentence structure.
* **Emojis:** üòÄ, üò≠. These convey emotional information.
* **Numbers:** "123," "3.14."  These can represent quantities or other numerical data.
* **Sub-words:** "pre-," "re-," "-ing," "-ed."  These can help with handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological information.
* **Phrases:** "ice cream," "New York."  These represent multi-word expressions that function as a single unit.

**Tokenizer Implementation**

While using whitespace as delimiters seems simple, it's inadequate for languages without clear word boundaries (e.g., Chinese).  Furthermore, handling punctuation and numbers requires more sophisticated methods.  A good tokenizer should correctly separate "51" and "." in a sentence like "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51."  We will explore more robust tokenization techniques later, including regular expressions and specialized tokenizers.


<----------section---------->


### Bag of Words Representation

**Turning Words into Numbers: One-hot Vectors**

One-hot encoding represents each word in a vocabulary as a vector. The vector's length equals the vocabulary size, and only the element corresponding to the word's index is 1; all others are 0.  While this preserves all information and allows document reconstruction, it creates very sparse, high-dimensional vectors.

**Limitations of One-hot Vectors:**

The sparsity leads to massive memory requirements for large vocabularies and corpora.  For example, a vocabulary of one million words and a corpus of 3,000 short books (3,500 sentences per book, 15 words per sentence) would require around 17.9 TB of storage using one-hot vectors, making it impractical.

**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**

BoW addresses the sparsity issue by summing the one-hot vectors for all words in a document.  This results in a single vector where each element represents the count of a specific word in the document.  While BoW is more memory-efficient, it loses word order information, which can be crucial for understanding meaning.  A binary variant of BoW simply indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word, disregarding its frequency.

**Binary BoW: Example**

Consider the corpus:

```python
sentences = [
    "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa at the age of 51.",
    "Leonardo was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.",
    "In addition to being a painter, Leonardo da Vinci was also a skilled engineer.",
    "Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle.",
    "The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most prestigious events in tennis.",
    "A tennis match is typically played as a best of three or best of five sets."
]
```

By generating a vocabulary and BoW vectors, we can observe the overlap in word usage between sentences.  This overlap, quantifiable using metrics like the dot product, allows us to compare documents and identify similarities.  BoW is foundational for document retrieval and search due to its efficiency and compatibility with hardware-accelerated binary operations.


<----------section---------->

### Token Normalization

**Improving Tokenization with Regular Expressions:**

Beyond whitespace, characters like tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), returns (`\r`), and punctuation also act as delimiters.  Regular expressions provide more control over tokenization, allowing us to handle these characters.  However, more complex scenarios like abbreviations, numbers, and special symbols may require dedicated tokenizers.

**Case Folding:**

Case folding reduces vocabulary size by converting all text to lowercase.  While this improves matching and recall, it can conflate words with different meanings (e.g., "US" vs. "us").  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is needed to preserve meaningful capitalization for proper nouns.

**Stop Words:**

Stop words are frequent words (e.g., "the," "a," "is") that often carry little semantic weight.  Removing them reduces noise and processing time, but can sometimes discard important contextual information (e.g., "Mark reported to the CEO" becomes "Mark reported CEO," changing the meaning).

**Combining Normalization Techniques:**

Combining regular expressions, case folding, and stop word removal significantly enhances basic text preprocessing. Libraries like NLTK offer extended stop word lists and other advanced preprocessing tools.

<----------section---------->

### Stemming and Lemmatization

**Stemming:**

Stemming reduces words to their root form (stem) by heuristically removing prefixes and suffixes.  While efficient, it can produce non-words (e.g., "running" becomes "runn").  The Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer (multilingual support) are common stemming algorithms available in NLTK.

**Lemmatization:**

Lemmatization, a more sophisticated approach, uses dictionaries and morphological analysis to determine a word's canonical form (lemma), considering its part of speech.  This always results in a valid word (e.g., "better" becomes "good"). Lemmatization is generally more accurate but computationally slower than stemming.

<----------section---------->

### Part of Speech (PoS) Tagging

PoS tagging assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to tokens, providing valuable information about sentence structure and word function.  This is crucial for tasks like lemmatization, parsing, and named entity recognition.  PoS tagging is inherently ambiguous due to words having multiple possible tags depending on context.  Algorithms use dictionaries, statistical models, and contextual information to disambiguate and assign the most likely tags. NLTK offers pre-trained PoS tagging models.

<----------section---------->

### Introducing spaCy

spaCy is a powerful open-source Python library for advanced NLP. It provides pre-trained language models with functionalities like tokenization, PoS tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, and NER.  spaCy offers detailed token attributes (e.g., `is_stop`, `pos_`, `lemma_`), simplifies common NLP tasks, and includes a built-in visualizer (displaCy) for analyzing syntactic dependencies and named entities.  spaCy's NER identifies and classifies real-world objects (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) with specific labels.

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 20: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**


<----------section---------->

### Outline

* Introduction to RAG
* Introduction to LangChain
* Building a RAG with LangChain and HuggingFace


<----------section---------->

### Introduction to RAG

**What is RAG?**

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess broad reasoning capabilities, yet they face inherent limitations:

* **Knowledge Cutoff:**  Their knowledge is confined to the data they were trained on.  This creates a "cutoff" date beyond which they are unaware of new information, world events, or evolving scientific understanding.
* **Inability to Access External Information:** LLMs, in their standard form, operate in isolation and cannot access real-time information from the internet or other external sources. This restricts their ability to respond to queries requiring current data.
* **Handling Private and Proprietary Data:**  Standard LLMs are not designed to process private or proprietary information.  Submitting such data to publicly available LLMs poses security risks and potential breaches of confidentiality.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by enriching LLMs with access to external and private data sources. This technique allows AI applications to leverage the power of LLMs while grounding their responses in specific, relevant information, broadening their knowledge beyond the training data and enabling them to work with sensitive data securely.


**RAG Concepts**

RAG applications typically involve two key stages:

* **Indexing (Offline):**  This process involves ingesting data from various sources and preparing it for efficient retrieval.  The data is transformed into a searchable format, often involving splitting large documents into smaller, manageable chunks and converting them into vector representations.
* **Retrieval and Generation (Runtime):** When a user submits a query, the system retrieves relevant information from the indexed data. This retrieved context is then integrated into a prompt that is fed to the LLM.  The LLM, now armed with pertinent information, generates a more informed and contextually appropriate response.


**Indexing**

The indexing stage consists of three main steps:

* **Load:**  Data is loaded from various sources, including files (PDF, CSV, HTML, JSON), websites, databases, and other repositories.  RAG frameworks often provide specialized loaders to handle different data formats.
* **Split (Chunking):**  Long documents are divided into smaller chunks.  This is crucial for two reasons: (1) smaller chunks are easier to search and retrieve efficiently, and (2) they fit within the limited context window of LLMs.
* **Store (Vectorization):**  The data chunks are stored in a Vector Store. This involves converting text chunks into vector representations (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based search.


**Vector Stores**

Vector Stores are specialized databases designed for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.

* **Embeddings Recap:** Embeddings are mathematical representations of text that capture semantic relationships between words and phrases.  Similar concepts have similar vector representations.
* **Semantic Search:** Vector stores enable semantic search, where retrieval is based on the meaning of the query and the indexed data, rather than just keyword matching. This allows for more accurate and relevant retrieval of information.


**Retrieval and Generation**

The runtime process involves:

* **Retrieval:** Based on the user's query, the system retrieves the most relevant data chunks from the Vector Store, using similarity search based on embeddings.
* **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved data is incorporated into a prompt along with the user's query.
* **LLM Generation:** This augmented prompt is fed to the LLM, enabling it to generate a response grounded in the retrieved context.


<----------section---------->


### Introduction to LangChain

**LangChain**

LangChain is a framework designed to streamline the development of LLM-powered applications.

* **Building Blocks:** It provides modular components for integrating LLMs into various workflows.
* **Connectivity:** It connects to diverse resources, including LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace), data sources (Slack, Notion), and external tools.
* **Chainable Components:**  LangChain's components can be chained together to create complex and sophisticated application logic.
* **Use Cases:**  It supports a wide range of applications like chatbots, document search, RAG, question answering, data processing, and information extraction.
* **Open Source and Commercial:** LangChain offers a mix of open-source and commercially available components.



**Key Components**

* **Prompt Templates:**  Standardized formats for structuring prompts, enabling dynamic and reusable interaction with LLMs.  Supports both string and message list formats for greater flexibility.
* **LLMs:**  Integration with various third-party LLMs, enabling seamless switching and experimentation with different models.
* **Chat Models:**  Specialized handling of conversational interfaces, enabling back-and-forth exchanges with LLMs. Supports distinct roles (user, assistant) within the conversation.
* **Example Selectors:**  Intelligently chooses relevant examples to include in prompts, improving LLM performance by providing context and guidance.
* **Output Parsers:** Structures LLM output into specific formats (JSON, XML, CSV), facilitating downstream processing and analysis. Includes features for error correction and handling complex output structures.
* **Document Loaders:**  Ingests data from diverse sources into a standardized format for use within the LangChain framework.
* **Vector Stores:** Integration with various vector storage solutions for efficient semantic search and retrieval of embeddings.
* **Retrievers:** Provides a unified interface for retrieving data from different sources, including vector stores and external databases.
* **Agents:** Empowers LLMs to make decisions and take actions based on user input, enabling more interactive and dynamic applications.


**Installation**

The following commands install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install langchain

**Lesson 21: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a crucial technique for refining Large Language Models (LLMs).  It explores the core concepts, workflow, benefits, drawbacks, and applications of RLHF, along with practical implementation guidance using the Transformers TRL library.  The document also contextualizes RLHF within the broader landscape of LLM development and fine-tuning.

<----------section---------->

<----------section---------->

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

**What is RLHF?**

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging human feedback to guide the learning process.  It aims to bridge the gap between objective model performance metrics and subjective human evaluations of desirable language generation, aligning model outputs with human values, preferences, and communication norms.

**Why RLHF?**

Traditional LLM training often relies heavily on large text corpora, which can lead to models that generate fluent but factually incorrect, biased, or unsafe outputs. RLHF addresses these limitations by directly incorporating human judgment into the training process. This results in models that are not only proficient in generating text but also better aligned with human expectations regarding safety, ethical considerations, and overall user satisfaction.

**Workflow of RLHF**

(See included image of workflow diagram)

The RLHF workflow typically involves three stages:

1. **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):** An initial LLM is fine-tuned on a dataset of prompts and corresponding human-generated responses.  This stage instills a basic understanding of desired behavior in the model.

2. **Reward Model Training:** A separate reward model is trained to score the quality of LLM-generated outputs. This model learns from human feedback, typically in the form of comparisons or rankings of different outputs for the same prompt.

3. **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning:** The initial LLM is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning algorithms, guided by the reward model. The LLM learns to generate outputs that maximize the reward score, effectively aligning its behavior with human preferences.


**Key components of RLHF**

* **Pre-trained Language Model:** A foundational LLM, pre-trained on a massive text corpus, serves as the starting point.  Examples include BERT, GPT, and T5.  This pre-training provides the model with a general understanding of language structure and semantics.
* **Reward Model:** A secondary model is trained to evaluate the quality of LLM outputs.  This model learns to predict human preference scores based on feedback provided on different generated outputs for the same prompt.
* **Fine-Tuning with Reinforcement Learning:** The pre-trained LLM is further refined using reinforcement learning, typically using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  The reward model's scores serve as the reinforcement signal, guiding the LLM towards generating outputs that align with human preferences.

**Reward model**

The training data for a reward model consists of:

* Multiple LLM-generated outputs for a set of given prompts.
* Corresponding human rankings or comparisons of these outputs, reflecting their preferences based on criteria such as factual accuracy, coherence, relevance, and safety.

The goal is to train a model capable of accurately predicting human preference scores for new, unseen LLM outputs.  The training process typically employs a ranking loss function that encourages the reward model to assign higher scores to outputs preferred by humans.

**Fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a commonly used reinforcement learning algorithm in RLHF.  The objective is to optimize the LLM to produce outputs that align with human-defined quality metrics, as captured by the reward model.  The process iteratively refines the LLM by:

1. Generating responses to prompts using the current version of the LLM.
2. Scoring these responses using the trained reward model.
3. Updating the LLM's parameters to maximize the expected reward, effectively learning to produce higher-quality outputs according to human preferences.

(See included image of PPO diagram)

**Pros and Cons of RLHF**

**Pros:**

* **Iterative Improvement:** RLHF allows for continuous improvement by incorporating new human feedback as the model evolves.  This iterative process enables the reward model and the LLM to be refined over time, leading to progressively better alignment with human preferences.
* **Improved Alignment:**  RLHF directly incorporates human feedback, resulting in models that generate responses more closely aligned with human intent, preferences, and communication norms.
* **Ethical Responses:** By incorporating human values, RLHF can mitigate the generation of harmful, biased, or unsafe outputs, promoting more responsible and ethical language generation.
* **User-Centric Behavior:**  RLHF can tailor LLM interactions to individual user preferences, creating more personalized and satisfying user experiences.

**Cons:**

* **Subjectivity:** Human feedback can be inherently subjective and vary significantly across individuals and demographics.  Managing this subjectivity is a key challenge in RLHF.
* **Scalability:**  Collecting sufficient quantities of high-quality human feedback can be resource-intensive, requiring careful design of feedback collection mechanisms and potentially significant human effort.
* **Reward Model Robustness:**  A misaligned or poorly trained reward model can negatively impact the fine-tuning process, leading to suboptimal LLM performance or even reinforcing undesirable behaviors.

<----------section---------->

**Tasks to enhance with RLHF**

RLHF can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including:

* **Text Generation:** Improve the quality, creativity, and relevance of generated text.
* **Dialogue Systems:** Enhance the naturalness, engagement, and helpfulness of conversational agents.
* **Language Translation:** Increase translation accuracy and fluency, capturing nuances and stylistic preferences.
* **Summarization:**  Generate more concise, informative, and insightful summaries.
* **Question Answering:** Improve the accuracy and completeness of answers, addressing complex questions more effectively.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Tailor sentiment identification to specific domains or business needs, accounting for subtle variations in expression.
* **Computer Programming:**  Assist in software development by generating code snippets, completing code, and suggesting improvements, based on natural language descriptions of desired functionality.


<----------section---------->

**Case study: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4**

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exemplify the successful application of RLHF. OpenAI reports that RLHF has led to:

* **Enhanced alignment:** Better adherence to user instructions and expectations.
* **Fewer unsafe outputs:**  Reduced generation of toxic, biased, or harmful content.
* **More human-like interactions:**  Improved naturalness and engagement in conversational contexts.

These models, widely used in applications like ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical benefits of RLHF in real-world scenarios.  The ongoing iterative improvement of these models with additional human feedback underscores the importance of continuous refinement in RLHF.


<----------section---------->


### Transformers TRL library

**TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)**

TRL is a comprehensive library designed specifically for training Transformer language models using reinforcement learning.  It provides a full suite of tools for implementing the key stages of RLHF, from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reward model training (RM) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

<----------section---------->

### Adding Guardrails to LLMs

**What are Guardrails?**

Guardrails are essential mechanisms and policies that govern the behavior of LLMs. They act as a safety net, ensuring that the model's responses are safe, accurate, relevant to the context, and align with desired ethical and operational guidelines.  Without guardrails, LLMs can be prone to generating harmful, biased, inaccurate, or inappropriate content.  Implementing guardrails is a critical step in building trust and reliability, paving the way for responsible LLM integration into real-world applications.

**Benefits of Guardrails:**

* **Mitigating Risks:** Preventing the generation of harmful, biased, or inaccurate outputs safeguards users and maintains the integrity of the application.
* **Enforcing Ethical Standards:**  Aligning responses with ethical guidelines ensures fairness, avoids discrimination, and promotes responsible AI usage.
* **Meeting Operational Objectives:** Guardrails help maintain control over LLM outputs, aligning them with specific business or user objectives and preventing undesirable behaviors.
* **Building Trust and Reliability:**  Demonstrating responsible AI practices through the implementation of guardrails builds trust among users and stakeholders.

**Examples of Guardrail Implementation:**

* **Content Filtering:** Blocking harmful or inappropriate content like hate speech, profanity, or personally identifiable information.
* **Domain Restriction:**  Confining LLM outputs to specific knowledge domains, preventing the model from venturing into areas where its knowledge is limited or unreliable.

**Types of Guardrails:**

* **Safety Guardrails:**  Focus on preventing the generation of harmful or offensive content, prioritizing user safety and well-being.
* **Domain-Specific Guardrails:**  Restrict responses to defined knowledge areas, ensuring accuracy and relevance within the intended scope.
* **Ethical Guardrails:**  Address concerns related to bias, misinformation, and fairness, promoting responsible AI practices.
* **Operational Guardrails:**  Control outputs to align with specific business rules, user objectives, or application requirements.

<----------section---------->

### Techniques for Adding Guardrails

Several techniques can be employed individually or in combination to implement robust guardrails for LLMs:

* **Rule-based Filters:**  Predefined rules that block or modify specific outputs based on keywords, regular expressions, or other criteria.  This is a simple and efficient technique for basic content filtering.
* **Fine-tuning with Custom Data:** Training the model on curated datasets tailored to specific domains or applications. This adjusts the model's internal weights, guiding it towards generating more desirable outputs.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully crafting prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and constrain its responses within desired boundaries. This involves providing explicit instructions within the prompt to shape the model's output.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica**

**Lesson 3: Math with Words**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**


This lesson explores fundamental mathematical concepts and techniques used to represent and analyze text in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on methods that pave the way for working with Large Language Models. We will cover Term Frequency, the Vector Space Model, TF-IDF, and the basic principles of building a search engine.

<----------section---------->

### Term Frequency

Term Frequency (TF) quantifies the importance of a word within a document based on its frequency of occurrence.  The underlying assumption is that words appearing more frequently are more central to the document's topic.  A common approach to represent text using TF is the Bag of Words (BoW) model.

**Bag of Words (BoW):**

The BoW model represents text as a vector of word counts, disregarding word order and grammar.  Different variations exist:

* **One-hot Encoding:** Each word in the vocabulary is represented as a vector with a single '1' at the index corresponding to the word and '0' elsewhere.  These vectors are combined to represent a document.

* **Binary BoW:** One-hot vectors are combined using the OR operation.  The resulting vector indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each word in the vocabulary within the document.

* **Standard BoW:** One-hot vectors are summed.  The resulting vector represents the count of each word in the vocabulary within the document.

* **Term Frequency (TF):**  While related to the Standard BoW, the TF specifically focuses on the raw counts of each word.


**Python Example:**

The following code snippet demonstrates how to extract tokens, build a BoW model, and calculate TF using the `spaCy` and `collections` libraries in Python:

```python
# Extract tokens
sentence = "The faster Harry got to the store, the faster Harry, the faster, would get home."

import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") # load the language model
doc = nlp(sentence)

tokens = [tok.lower_ for tok in doc if not tok.is_stop and not tok.is_punct]

print(tokens)

# Build BoW with word count

import collections

bag_of_words = collections.Counter(tokens) # counts the elements of a list
print(bag_of_words)

# Most common words
print(bag_of_words.most_common(2)) # most common 2 words


import pandas as pd

counts = pd.Series(bag_of_words) # from dict to Pandas Series
print(counts / counts.sum()) # calculate TF
```

**Limitations of TF:**

Relying solely on raw word counts can be misleading.  A word appearing many times in a long document might not be as significant as the same word appearing fewer times in a short document.

**Illustrative Example:**

Consider two documents:

* Document A: A 30-word email mentioning "dog" 3 times.
* Document B: The novel *War & Peace* (approximately 580,000 words) mentioning "dog" 100 times.

While "dog" appears more frequently in Document B, its relative importance is higher in Document A.


### Normalized TF

Normalized TF addresses the limitations of raw TF by dividing the word count by the total number of words in the document.

* TF (dog, Document A) = 3/30 = 0.1
* TF (dog, Document B) = 100/580000 = 0.00017

This normalization provides a more accurate representation of a word's importance relative to the document length.


<----------section---------->

### Vector Space Model

The Vector Space Model (VSM) represents documents as vectors in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a term in the vocabulary. The values in each dimension typically represent the TF or normalized TF of the corresponding term in the document.  This allows for mathematical comparison of documents based on their vector representations.

**NLTK Corpora:**

The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides access to various text corpora useful for training and testing NLP algorithms.

**Reuters 21578 Corpus:**

This corpus contains thousands of categorized news articles, suitable for tasks like text classification.

**Python Example (using Reuters 21578):**

```python
import nltk

nltk.download('reuters') # download the reuters corpus
ids = nltk.corpus.reuters.fileids() # ids of the documents
sample = nltk.corpus.reuters.raw(ids[0]) # first document

print(len(ids), "samples.\n") # number of documents
print(sample)

# ... (Further code examples for processing the corpus)
```

### Corpus Processing:

Efficient processing of large corpora often involves optimizing code by disabling unnecessary components of NLP pipelines, such as named entity recognition or parsing when dealing solely with TF or TF-IDF.

**Term-Document Matrix:**

A term-document matrix is a mathematical representation of a corpus where rows represent documents and columns represent terms. Each cell contains the TF, normalized TF, or other relevant metric for a given term in a given document.  This matrix is the basis for building the VSM.

### Document Similarity:

VSM enables calculating document similarity using various metrics:

* **Euclidean Distance:**  Measures the straight-line distance between two vectors.  Sensitive to vector magnitude and less commonly used in NLP.

* **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, focusing on direction and ignoring magnitude. More effective for normalized text representations and widely used in NLP.

**Properties of Cosine Similarity:**

Cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1:

* 1: Perfect similarity, indicating identical word usage proportions.
* 0: No similarity, indicating no shared words.
* -1: Perfect dissimilarity.  While theoretically possible, this is generally not encountered with TF-based representations.


```python
# ... (Code example for calculating cosine similarity)
```


<----------section---------->

### TF-IDF

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) improves upon TF by considering a term's prevalence across the entire corpus.  It reduces the weight of common words and increases the weight of rare words that are more likely to be informative.

**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**

IDF measures how unique a word is across the corpus.

**TF-IDF Calculation:**

TF-IDF is calculated as the product of TF and IDF. A high TF-IDF score indicates a term that is frequent within a document but rare across the corpus, suggesting high relevance to that document.

**Zipf‚Äôs Law:**

Zipf‚Äôs Law describes the inverse relationship between a word's rank in a frequency table and its frequency of occurrence in natural language.  This principle influences the effectiveness of IDF.

**Python Examples:**

```python
# ... (Code example for calculating TF-IDF)
```

**Using Scikit-Learn:**

The `scikit-learn` library provides efficient implementations for calculating TF-IDF.

```python
# ... (Code example for calculating TF-IDF using scikit-learn)
```

**TF-IDF Alternatives:**  Other methods for weighting terms exist and might be more suitable for specific applications. Some examples include BM25, probabilistic models, and word embeddings.


<----------section---------->

### Building a Search Engine

TF-IDF matrices form the foundation of many information retrieval systems.

**Basic Search Engine Process:**

1. **Create TF-IDF Matrix:** Tokenize and create a TF-IDF matrix for all documents in the corpus.
2. **Process Query:** Tokenize the user's search query and create its TF-IDF vector.
3. **Calculate Similarity:**  Calculate the cosine similarity between the query vector and all document vectors in the matrix.
4. **Rank Results:** Rank documents based on their cosine similarity to the query, presenting the most similar documents first.

```python
# ... (Code example for building a basic search engine)
```

**Advanced Search Engines:**  Real-world search engines employ more sophisticated techniques like inverted indexes for efficiency, along with other ranking factors beyond TF-IDF.

## Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

**Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica - Lesson 4: Text Classification**

**Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco**

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of text classification, focusing on its application in various NLP tasks. We will explore the different types of classification, the machine learning pipeline for building a text classifier, and delve into specific examples using the Reuters and IMDB datasets.  We'll also discuss evaluation metrics for assessing classifier performance.


<----------section---------->

**Outline**

* Text Classification: An overview of the process and its distinctions from other document-related tasks.
* Topic Labelling Example:  Practical application of text classification using the Reuters news dataset.
* Sentiment Analysis Exercise: Building a sentiment classifier with the IMDB movie review dataset.


<----------section---------->

**Text Classification**

Text classification assigns predefined categories to text documents based solely on their content, disregarding metadata. This differs from *document classification*, which considers metadata, and *document clustering*, which discovers categories from unlabeled data.  Text classification is crucial for various applications, including spam detection, sentiment analysis, topic categorization, and intent recognition in conversational AI.


<----------section---------->

**Definition**

Formally, given a set of documents *D* = {d‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, d‚Çô} and a set of predefined classes *C* = {c‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, c‚Çò}, text classification seeks a classifier function:

*F*: *D* x *C* ‚Üí {True, False}

This function *F* determines whether a document d·µ¢ belongs to class c‚±º, assigning a Boolean value accordingly.


<----------section---------->

**Types of Classification**

* **Single-label:** Each document is assigned to exactly one class. This is appropriate when categories are mutually exclusive.
* **Binary:** A special case of single-label classification with only two classes (e.g., spam/not spam).  It simplifies the problem to a yes/no decision regarding a single category.
* **Multi-label:**  A document can belong to multiple classes simultaneously (e.g., a news article categorized as both "finance" and "politics").  This type acknowledges that documents can address multiple topics or themes.


<----------section---------->

**ML-Based Classification**

Machine learning (ML) is commonly employed for text classification.  A model learns from a training set of annotated documents, where each document is associated with its correct class labels. The process generally involves:

1. **Text Representation:** Converting text into a numerical vector format that ML algorithms can process. Common approaches include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which weighs words based on their importance within a document and across the corpus.
2. **Model Training:**  Using a labeled dataset to train an ML algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks) to learn the relationship between text features and class labels.
3. **Prediction:** Applying the trained model to classify new, unseen documents by predicting their likely categories. The model often provides a confidence score, indicating the certainty of the classification.


<----------section---------->

**Topic Labelling Example: Classifying Reuters News**

The Reuters 21578 dataset provides a real-world example of multi-class and multi-label text classification.  Containing news articles classified into 90 distinct categories, this dataset highlights the complexities of real-world text data.  Its characteristics include:

* **Multi-class:**  A wide range of categories representing different news topics.
* **Multi-label:**  Articles can belong to multiple categories.
* **Imbalanced Classes:** Uneven distribution of documents across categories, with some having significantly more examples than others. This poses a challenge for model training and requires careful consideration during evaluation.
* **Variable Document Length:**  The number of words per document varies, requiring appropriate handling during vectorization.

Further dataset statistics are available at https://martin-thoma.com/nlp-reuters/.  Working with this dataset provides valuable experience in addressing common challenges in text classification.


<----------section---------->

**Corpus Management (Code Example Included in Original Submission)**

This section outlines the practical steps for managing and processing the corpus for text classification:

1. **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transforming text documents into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, capturing the importance of words in each document and the corpus.
3. **Label Encoding:** Converting class labels into a numerical format suitable for ML algorithms. One-hot encoding is often used for multi-label classification, creating a binary vector for each class.
4. **Model Training:** Training a chosen ML classifier (e.g., Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) using the vectorized text and encoded labels.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained classifier's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics.

**Pre-Processing (Code Example Included in Original Submission)**

The `fit_transform` method efficiently combines the fitting and transforming steps in data pre-processing.

**MLP Classifier Training (Code Example and Graph Included in Original Submission)**

This section demonstrates the training process of an MLP classifier using the pre-processed data.

<----------section---------->

**Testing Metrics**

Evaluating classifier performance requires appropriate metrics.  For multi-class and multi-label problems, several averaging methods are used:

* **Micro Average:**  Calculates metrics globally by considering the total true positives, false negatives, and false positives across all classes. This approach is sensitive to class imbalance.
* **Macro Average:** Computes the metric for each class independently and then averages the results. This treats all classes equally, regardless of their size.
* **Weighted Average:**  Averages the metric for each class, weighted by the number of true instances (support) for each class. This balances the influence of different class sizes.
* **Samples Average:** Calculates metrics at the instance level, averaging the performance across individual samples. This is particularly relevant for multi-label classification where each instance can have multiple labels.

**Testing Results (Code Example and Output Included in Original Submission)**

This section presents the results of the classifier evaluation, including the chosen metrics.


<----------section---------->


**Sentiment Analysis Exercise**

Sentiment analysis, a specific application of text classification, aims to determine the emotional tone expressed in text (positive, negative, or neutral). Its applications are wide-ranging, including:

* **Business:** Understanding customer feedback and brand perception.
* **Finance:**  Gauging market sentiment and predicting stock movements.
* **Politics:** Analyzing public opinion and political discourse.


<----------section---------->

**IMDB Dataset**

The IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks.  Its balanced class distribution simplifies evaluation.  The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews.


<----------section---------->

**Exercise**

The exercise involves building a sentiment classifier using the IMDB dataset:

1. **Data Preparation:** Download and preprocess the IMDB dataset, splitting it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. **Label Encoding:** One-hot encode the sentiment labels (positive/negative) using `OneHotEncoder`.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Create TF-IDF vectors from the movie reviews, considering words appearing in at least 5 documents to reduce dimensionality and computational cost.
4. **Model Training:** Train a classifier (e.g., an MLP or another suitable algorithm) using the vectorized reviews and encoded labels.
5. **Evaluation:**  Evaluate the classifier's performance on the test set using relevant metrics and visualize the results with a confusion matrix, plotted using a Seaborn heatmap. This helps visualize the model's performance in classifying positive and negative reviews.

**Suggestions**

Specific tools and techniques are suggested for the exercise:

* `OneHotEncoder` for label encoding.
* TF-IDF vectorization with a minimum document frequency of 5.
* `confusion_matrix` for generating the confusion matrix.
* Seaborn heatmaps for visualization (install with `pip install seaborn`; documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html).

**DIEM ‚Äì University of Salerno**

This document provides an enhanced version of the original lesson materials, expanding on key concepts and providing additional context for improved clarity and understanding.

<----------section---------->

### Introduction to Word Embeddings and Their Significance

This lesson explores the evolution of text representation in Natural Language Processing (NLP), moving from basic term frequency methods like TF-IDF to the more nuanced world of word embeddings.  Word embeddings offer a powerful way to capture the semantic meaning of words, enabling a deeper understanding of text and facilitating more complex NLP tasks.

<----------section---------->

### Limitations of TF-IDF

While TF-IDF is a valuable tool for gauging term importance within a document, it has limitations when it comes to capturing semantic relationships. TF-IDF relies on exact word matching, meaning documents with similar meanings but different wording will have distinct TF-IDF vector representations.

**Examples:**

* The movie was amazing and exciting.
* The film was incredible and thrilling.
* The team conducted a detailed analysis of the data and found significant correlations between variables.
* The group performed an in-depth examination of the information and discovered notable relationships among factors.

**Term Normalization:**

Techniques like stemming (reducing words to their root form) and lemmatization (finding the dictionary form of a word) can help address this issue by grouping similar words under a single token. However, these methods are not without their shortcomings:

**Disadvantages:**

* **Limited Synonym Grouping:** Stemming and lemmatization primarily focus on morphological variations, often failing to capture synonyms with different roots.
* **Potential for Misgrouping:** They can inadvertently group words with similar spellings but different meanings.
* **Example (Leading):** _She is leading the project_ vs _The plumber leads the pipe_.
* **Example (Bat):** _The bat flew out of the cave_ vs _He hit the ball with a bat_.


**TF-IDF Applications:**

Despite its limitations, TF-IDF remains effective for various NLP applications:

* **Information Retrieval (Search Engines):** Identifying relevant documents based on keyword searches.
* **Information Filtering (Document Recommendation):** Suggesting documents similar to those a user has previously interacted with.
* **Text Classification:** Categorizing documents based on their content.

However, tasks requiring a deeper understanding of semantics necessitate more advanced techniques:

* **Text Generation (Chatbots):** Creating human-like text responses.
* **Automatic Translation:** Converting text from one language to another while preserving meaning.
* **Question Answering:** Providing accurate answers to questions posed in natural language.
* **Paraphrasing and Text Rewriting:** Rephrasing text while maintaining the original meaning.


<----------section---------->

### Bag-of-Words (Recap)

The Bag-of-Words model represents words as one-hot vectors, where each word is assigned a unique index in the vocabulary. This representation suffers from several drawbacks:

* **Lack of Semantic Representation:** The distance between any two one-hot vectors is always the same, failing to capture semantic relationships between words.
* **Inefficiency:** One-hot vectors are sparse, requiring significant memory and processing resources, especially for large vocabularies.
* **Example:**  In a vocabulary of *n* words, each word is represented by a vector of length *n* with only one non-zero element. This leads to high dimensionality and sparsity.


<----------section---------->

### Word Embeddings: A Semantic Approach

Word embeddings address the limitations of Bag-of-Words by representing words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. These vectors are designed to capture semantic relationships, placing words with similar meanings closer together.

**Key Features:**

* **Dense Representation:** Embeddings use significantly fewer dimensions than the vocabulary size, resulting in more compact representations.
* **Semantic Encoding:**  The position of a word vector in the vector space reflects its meaning, enabling semantic reasoning.

**Example:**

* Apple = (0.25,0.16)
* Banana = (0.33,0.10)
* King = (0.29,0.68)
* Queen = (0.51,0.71)


**Word Embedding Properties:**

* **Vector Arithmetic:**  Word embeddings allow for semantic reasoning through vector operations.  For example, `king - man + woman ‚âà queen`.
* **Semantic Queries:** Enable searching for words based on their meaning rather than exact spelling.  `wv['famous'] + wv['European'] + wv['woman'] + wv['physicist'] ‚âà wv['Marie_Curie']`.
* **Analogies:**  Facilitate answering analogy questions by leveraging semantic relationships. `wv['Marie_Curie'] ‚Äì wv['science'] + wv['music'] ‚âà wv['Ludwig_van_Beethoven']`.

**Visualizing Word Embeddings:**

Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to visualize word embeddings in a lower-dimensional space, revealing semantic clusters.


<----------section---------->

### Learning Word Embeddings: Word2Vec

Word2Vec, introduced by Google in 2013, is a neural network-based method for generating word embeddings using unsupervised learning on large text corpora.  The core idea is that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.

**Word2Vec Architectures:**

* **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW):** Predicts a target word given its surrounding context words.  Suitable for frequent words and large datasets.
* **Skip-Gram:** Predicts surrounding context words given a target word.  Effective for small corpora and rare terms.

**Word2Vec Improvements:**

* **Frequent Bigrams:**  Treating frequent word pairs as single tokens to improve representation of compound terms.
* **Subsampling Frequent Tokens:** Reducing the influence of common words (like stop words) during training.
* **Negative Sampling:**  Improving training efficiency by updating only a small subset of weights for each training example.


<----------section---------->

### Word2Vec Alternatives

* **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):**  Uses matrix factorization techniques for faster training and comparable accuracy.
* **FastText:**  Leverages subword information, making it effective for rare words, morphologically rich languages, and handling misspellings.

<----------section---------->


### Static vs. Contextualized Embeddings

* **Static Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText):** Each word has a single, fixed vector representation, regardless of context. This can be problematic for polysemous words (words with multiple meanings) and doesn't capture semantic drift (changes in word meaning over time). They can also perpetuate biases present in the training data.  Handling out-of-vocabulary words is a challenge.
* **Contextualized Embeddings (ELMo, BERT):** Generate word vectors dynamically based on the surrounding context, addressing the limitations of static embeddings.


<----------section---------->

### Working with Word Embeddings

Libraries like Gensim and spaCy provide tools for loading pre-trained word embeddings, calculating word similarity, and performing vector arithmetic.  Gensim also supports training custom word embedding models.

<----------section---------->

### Recurrent Neural Networks

#### Neural Networks and NLP

Neural networks are widely used in text processing. A limitation of traditional feedforward networks is their lack of memory.  Each input is processed independently, without retaining any information from previous inputs.  This means that when processing text, a feedforward network must receive the entire sequence of words at once, treating the entire text as a single data point. This approach is commonly used with Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF vectors, where text is represented as a fixed-length vector.  Another similar approach involves averaging the word embeddings of all the words in a text. However, these methods lose the sequential information inherent in language.

#### Neural Networks with Memory

Human text comprehension relies heavily on sequential processing and memory.  When reading, we process sentences and words one by one, retaining a memory of what we have read previously. This allows us to understand context and build a mental model of the text's meaning, continuously updating this model as new information is encountered.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) aim to mimic this process.  They iterate over the elements of a sequence (e.g., words in a text represented as word embeddings), maintaining an internal state that stores information about the preceding sequence. This ‚Äústate‚Äù enables the network to consider past information when processing current input.


#### Recurrent Neural Networks (Structure)

RNNs utilize feedforward network layers (typically represented as circles in diagrams) which are composed of one or more neurons. The key difference from standard feedforward networks is the recurrent connection: the output of the hidden layer at each time step is not only sent to the output layer but is also fed back as input to the hidden layer at the *next* time step. This feedback loop allows the network to maintain its internal state and process sequential information.

#### Unrolling the RNN

"Unrolling" an RNN is a visualization technique that helps illustrate its operation over time.  Each time step is represented as a separate copy of the RNN cell, processing a new element in the sequence.  It is crucial to understand that the weights of the connections within the RNN cell are shared across all time steps. This weight sharing is a fundamental characteristic of RNNs, allowing them to learn general patterns from sequences of varying lengths.

#### Inside the RNN

At each time step *t*, the RNN receives two inputs: an input vector (representing the current word or token in the sequence) and the hidden vector (the network‚Äôs state) from the previous time step (t-1).  For the very first input (t=0), there is no previous hidden state, so the initial hidden state is typically initialized to a vector of zeros.  Inside the RNN cell, trainable weight matrices connect the input to the hidden layer, the hidden layer to the output layer, and the hidden layer to itself (this last connection constitutes the recurrent connection). These weight matrices are learned during training.

#### Using RNNs with Text

An RNN processes text sequentially, one token at a time. The output from each time step, representing the network‚Äôs understanding of the sequence up to that point, is fed back into the network as input for the next time step.  This mechanism allows the network to maintain a "memory" of the preceding context.  For tasks like text classification, typically only the final output of the RNN, after processing the entire sequence, is used for making the prediction.


#### RNN Training

RNNs are trained using a modified version of backpropagation called Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). In BPTT, the error is calculated based on the final output of the network and then propagated back through all time steps, updating the shared weights at each step.  This allows the network to learn how its decisions at earlier time steps affected the final output.


#### What are RNNs Good For?

RNNs are well-suited for a variety of sequence processing tasks, which can be broadly categorized as:

* **One-to-Many:**  One input generates a sequence of outputs (e.g., image captioning, music generation).
* **Many-to-One:** A sequence of inputs produces a single output (e.g., sentiment classification, topic categorization).
* **Many-to-Many:** A sequence of inputs generates a sequence of outputs (e.g., machine translation, speech recognition).

A significant advantage of RNNs is their ability to handle variable-length text sequences naturally.  This eliminates the need for padding shorter sequences or truncating longer ones, preserving the integrity of the input data.


#### RNNs for Text Generation

When using RNNs for text generation, the output at each time step is significant. It represents the next predicted word in the sequence. The error is calculated and backpropagated at each step, influencing the network‚Äôs weights and enabling it to learn the statistical relationships between words in the training corpus.


<----------section---------->


#### RNN Variants

Several variants of RNNs have been developed to address limitations and improve performance:

* **Bidirectional RNN:** Processes the sequence both forward and backward.  The outputs from the forward and backward passes are concatenated at each time step.  This allows the network to capture information from both past and future context, which can be beneficial for tasks like named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.
* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**  Addresses the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in training RNNs where gradients become very small during backpropagation, hindering learning. LSTMs introduce a memory cell and gates (input, output, and forget gates) to control information flow and maintain long-term dependencies.
* **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** A simpler alternative to LSTM, also designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. GRUs use update and reset gates to control the flow of information. They often achieve comparable performance to LSTMs with fewer parameters, making them computationally more efficient.
* **Stacked LSTM/GRU:** Multiple LSTM or GRU layers can be stacked on top of each other. This allows the network to learn hierarchical representations of the sequence, with higher layers capturing more complex patterns.


#### Using Ragged Tensors

Ragged tensors are data structures designed to efficiently handle variable-length sequences, eliminating the need for padding. TensorFlow and similar deep learning frameworks provide support for ragged tensors. PyTorch offers similar functionality through Packed Sequences. These structures optimize memory usage and computational efficiency during training and inference.

### Building a Spam Detector

This section requires an implementation of a spam detector using RNNs, ideally with code examples.  The original text does not provide details on this implementation.  A basic example using a simple RNN or LSTM to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their text content would be beneficial.

```python
# Example (Illustrative -  Requires further development)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the RNN model
class SpamDetector(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, text, text_lengths):
        embedded = self.embedding(text)
        packed_embedded = nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(embedded, text_lengths, enforce_sorted=False)
        packed_output, (hidden, cell) = self.rnn(packed_embedded)
        output, output_lengths = nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence(packed_output)
        hidden = hidden[-1, :, :] # get last hidden state
        output = self.fc(hidden)
        return self.sigmoid(output)

# Example usage (Illustrative)
vocab_size = 10000  # Replace with actual vocabulary size
embedding_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 256
output_dim = 1 # Binary classification (spam/not spam)

model = SpamDetector(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)

# ...  (Training loop and data preprocessing would go here)
```

### Intro to Text Generation

#### Generative Models

Generative models are a class of machine learning models designed to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new data points that resemble the training data. Unlike discriminative models, which are used for classification or regression tasks, generative models are concerned with creating original data.  RNNs and Transformers are prominent examples of generative models used in NLP.


#### Applications

Text generation has a wide range of applications in various fields:

* **Machine Translation:**  Generating text in a target language given text in a source language.
* **Question Answering:** Generating answers to given questions.
* **Automatic Summarization:**  Generating concise summaries of longer texts.
* **Text Completion:**  Predicting the next words in a given text prompt.
* **Dialogue Systems:** Generating responses in a conversational setting.
* **Creative Writing:**  Generating poems, scripts, stories, and other forms of creative text.



#### Language Model

A language model (LM) assigns probabilities to sequences of words. It predicts the probability of the next word in a sequence given the preceding words.  This allows the model to capture the statistical structure of language, learning the likelihood of different word combinations. New text sequences are generated by sampling from this probability distribution, starting with a seed text and iteratively adding predicted tokens.


#### LM Training

An RNN-based language model is trained by feeding it sequences of tokens. At each time step, the RNN receives a token and predicts the next one in the sequence. The prediction is compared with the actual next token in the training data, and the error is backpropagated to update the network‚Äôs weights.  This process is repeated for each token in each sequence in the training corpus.



#### Sampling

Generative models employ sampling techniques to introduce randomness and diversity into the generated text.  Instead of always selecting the word with the highest predicted probability, the model samples from the probability distribution, allowing for less likely but potentially more creative or interesting word choices.



#### Temperature

Temperature (T) is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the sampling process.  It modifies the probability distribution before sampling:

`q_i = exp(log(p_i) / T) / sum(exp(log(p_j) / T))`

where `p_i` is the original probability of the i-th word and `q_i` is the modified probability after applying the temperature.

* **Lower Temperatures (T < 1):** Make the model more deterministic, favoring words with higher probabilities. This results in more predictable and less diverse text.
* **Higher Temperatures (T > 1):** Increase randomness and surprise, allowing the model to sample less likely words. This leads to more creative and diverse but potentially less coherent text.

### Building a Poetry Generator


#### Leopardi Poetry Generator

This example uses a corpus of Giacomo Leopardi's poetry to train a character-level language model.  This means that the RNN will process the text one character at a time, learning the statistical relationships between characters in Leopardi's writing style.

#### Extract the Training Samples

The corpus is divided into sequences of characters of a fixed length (maxlen). Each sequence serves as input to the RNN, and the next character in the corpus following the sequence is the target output.


#### Build and Train the Model

An LSTM model is trained to predict the next character in the sequence.  The choice of LSTM is motivated by its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is relevant for modeling the complexities of poetic language.

```python
# Example (Illustrative - Requires further development)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PoetryGenerator(nn.Module):
  # ... (Define LSTM model similar to SpamDetector, but for character-level input)

# ... (Training loop and data preprocessing, similar to SpamDetector example)
```

#### Generate a new Poetry

Helper functions sample from the model's predictions at each character step and concatenate the sampled characters to generate new text, starting from a seed character or sequence. The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated poetry, as explained earlier.

<----------section---------->

### Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of dialogue engines, focusing on building task-oriented dialogue systems.  It begins by differentiating between chit-chat and task-oriented systems, then delves into the architecture of a typical task-oriented dialogue system.  The document then introduces Rasa, a popular open-source framework for building these systems, covering its key components, installation, project structure, essential files, commands, API, and integration with web frontends.  Finally, it touches upon custom actions and provides valuable resources for further learning.

<----------section---------->

### Dialogue System Types

Conversational AI systems can be broadly categorized into two main types:

* **Chit-Chat Systems:** These systems are designed for open-ended conversations without a specific goal.  The primary focus is on generating human-like, engaging responses, and the success is often measured by the length and natural flow of the conversation.  Examples include casual conversation bots and entertainment-focused chatbots.

* **Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems (TOD):**  TOD systems are designed to assist users in accomplishing specific tasks. They prioritize understanding user requests, tracking the conversation's context, and generating actions to fulfill the user's goal.  Efficiency is key, aiming to minimize the number of conversational turns needed to complete the task. Examples include booking flights, scheduling meetings, providing information, and controlling smart home devices.

**Examples of Task-Oriented Dialogue:**

* **Information Retrieval:** "Which room is the dialogue tutorial in?" or "When is the IJCNLP 2017 conference?"
* **Task Completion:** "Book me a flight from Seattle to Taipei." or "Schedule a meeting with Bill at 10:00 tomorrow."
* **Recommendation:** "Can you suggest me a restaurant?" or "Can you suggest me something to see near me?"


<----------section---------->

### TOD System Architecture

A typical TOD system consists of three core modules:

* **Input Modules ("Ears"):** This module is responsible for receiving and interpreting user input. It typically includes Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components to extract meaning from text and may also incorporate Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements for structured input.

* **Dialogue Management ("Brain"):**  This is the central component that controls the conversation flow.  It manages the conversation's context, stores user-specific information, interacts with backend systems (databases, APIs, and other services), and connects to various conversational platforms. This module determines the appropriate actions based on the user input and the current dialogue state.

* **Output Modules ("Mouth"):** This module generates the system's responses. It uses Natural Language Generation (NLG) components to produce human-readable text and may also utilize GUI elements like buttons, images, and other interactive components.


<----------section---------->

### Rasa: A Framework for Building TOD Systems

Rasa (https://rasa.com/) is an open-source framework specifically designed for building TOD systems.  It offers a flexible and powerful platform for developing sophisticated conversational AI assistants.

<----------section---------->

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

NLU is a crucial component of any conversational AI system.  It involves two primary tasks:

* **Intent Classification:** This task aims to identify the user's intention or goal expressed in their message.  It is typically approached as a multi-label sentence classification problem. For example, the utterance "What's the weather like tomorrow?" might be classified with the intent `request_weather`.

* **Entity Recognition:** This task involves identifying and extracting specific pieces of information (entities) from the user's message.  This can be achieved using Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques, which can be rule-based or machine learning-based.  In the example above, "tomorrow" would be recognized as a date entity.

<----------section---------->

### Conversation Design

Effective conversation design is essential for creating engaging and user-friendly chatbots.  The process involves:

* **User Analysis:**  Understanding the target audience, their needs, and their communication style.
* **Purpose Definition:** Clearly defining the assistant's purpose and the tasks it should be able to handle.
* **Conversation Flow Mapping:** Documenting typical conversation flows and anticipating potential user interactions.

It is challenging to predict every possible user query.  Start with hypothetical conversations during initial development, then refine the system using real user interactions gathered during testing and deployment.  This iterative approach allows the bot to adapt to real-world usage patterns.

<----------section---------->

### Introduction to Rasa (Detailed)

Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework initially released in 2016. It is widely used for developing conversational assistants in multiple languages.

**Rasa Building Blocks:**

* **Intents:** Represent the user's goal or intention within a conversation.
* **Entities:** Specific pieces of information relevant to the user's intent, such as dates, locations, or names.
* **Actions:**  The bot's responses to user intents, which can range from simple text replies to complex custom actions.
* **Responses:** Predefined text utterances used by the bot.
* **Custom Actions:** Python code enabling complex interactions with external systems, databases, or APIs.
* **Slots:** Variables that store information extracted from user input during the conversation.
* **Forms:**  Structured ways to collect multiple pieces of information from the user by filling predefined slots.
* **Stories:** Example conversation flows used for training the dialogue management model.  These define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions.  They act as training data for the dialogue model to learn how to respond in different scenarios.
* **Rules:** Define short, specific conversation patterns that always follow the same path.  These are particularly useful for handling simple, predictable interactions.


<----------section---------->

### Installing and Setting up Rasa

1. **Virtual Environment:** Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies: `python -m venv rasa.env` and `source rasa.env/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `rasa.env\Scripts\activate` (Windows).  This prevents conflicts with other Python projects.

2. **Rasa Installation:** Install Rasa within the virtual environment: `pip install rasa`.

3. **Project Initialization:** Create a new Rasa project using: `rasa init`. This command generates a basic project structure with example files and configurations.


<----------section---------->


### Rasa Project Structure

A Rasa project follows a specific directory structure:

* **`actions`:** Contains custom action code written in Python.  This directory houses the logic for actions that go beyond simple text responses, like interacting with external APIs or databases.

* **`data`:** Stores the training data for NLU and dialogue management.  Key files include:
    * **`nlu.yml`:** Defines intents, examples of user utterances, and entity annotations for training the NLU model.
    * **`rules.yml`:** Defines rule-based dialogue flows for specific scenarios.
    * **`stories.yml`:** Contains stories representing example conversation flows for training the dialogue management model.


* **`models`:**  Stores the trained NLU and dialogue management models.

* **`tests`:** Contains test cases for evaluating the chatbot's performance.

* **`config.yml`:** Defines the NLU pipeline and dialogue management policies. This file configures the components used for processing user input and making decisions about the bot's responses. It includes settings for tokenizers, featurizers, intent classifiers, entity extractors, and dialogue policies.

* **`credentials.yml`:** Stores credentials for connecting to external services like messaging platforms or databases.

* **`domain.yml`:**  The central configuration file listing all intents, entities, slots, responses, forms, and actions.  It acts as a blueprint for the chatbot's capabilities.

* **`endpoints.yml`:**  Configures the endpoints that the bot can use, such as action servers or messaging channels.


<----------section---------->

### Key Rasa Files and Commands (Detailed)


**`domain.yml` (Example):**

```yaml
intents:
- greet
- goodbye
- ...

responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Bye"
  ...

session_config:
  session_expiration_time: 60  # minutes
  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true
```

The `session_config` section manages conversation sessions. `session_expiration_time` defines the inactivity duration before a session expires. `carry_over_slots_to_new_session` determines if slot values are preserved across sessions.  This is useful for maintaining context if a user returns after a short break.

**`nlu.yml` (Example):**

```yaml
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - hey
    - hello
    - hi
    - ...
```

Rasa requires a sufficient number of examples (7-10 minimum) per intent to effectively train the NLU model to recognize and classify user intentions.  These examples should cover variations in phrasing and vocabulary.

**`stories.yml` (Example):**

```yaml
- story: happy path
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - intent: mood_great
  - action: utter_happy
```

Stories define sequences of user intents and corresponding bot actions. They serve as training data for the dialogue management model to learn appropriate responses in different conversational contexts.

**`rules.yml` (Example):**

```yaml
- rule: Say goodbye anytime the user says goodbye
  steps:
  - intent: goodbye
  - action: utter_goodbye
```

Rules specify simple, deterministic dialogue flows. Unlike stories, rules are not used for training a machine learning model; they are applied directly as hard-coded logic.


**Visualizing Stories:**  Use `rasa visualize` to generate a graphical representation of the conversation flows defined in your stories. This helps in understanding and debugging the dialogue flow.


**Rasa Commands:**

* `rasa train`: Trains the NLU and dialogue management models using the data in the `data` directory and the configuration in `config.yml`.  The trained models are saved in the `models` directory.

* `rasa shell`: Starts an interactive shell where you can test the trained chatbot by typing messages.  This allows you to interact with the bot and evaluate its responses in a controlled environment.

* `rasa run`: Starts a server to deploy the chatbot, making it accessible via HTTP.  The `--cors "*" ` option enables cross-origin requests, allowing interaction from web applications hosted on different domains.

* `rasa -h`: Displays help information and lists all available commands.

<----------section---------->

### Rasa REST API

Rasa offers a REST API for integrating the chatbot with external systems.  This enables communication between your chatbot and web applications, mobile apps, or other services.

* **REST Channel Configuration:** Add the REST channel to your `credentials.yml` file to enable the REST endpoint.  Restart the Rasa server for the changes to take effect.

* **REST Endpoint:**  The bot becomes accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/rest/webhook` after configuring and restarting the server.  Refer to the official Rasa documentation for details: https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/connectors/your-own-website/

* **Request and Response Format (Example):**

    **Request (JSON):**

    ```json
    {
      "sender": "test_user",
      "message": "I'm sad!"
    }
    ```

    **Response (JSON):**

    ```json
    [
      {
        "recipient_id": "test_user",
        "text": "Here is something to cheer you up:"
      },
      {
        "recipient_id": "test_user",
        "image": "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
      },
      {
        "recipient_id": "test_user",
        "text": "Did that help you?"
      }
    ]
    ```


<----------section---------->

### Web-based Frontends for Rasa

Integrating a Rasa chatbot into a website can be achieved through:

* **Custom Implementation:** Developing a custom frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle user interaction and communicate with the Rasa server via the REST API or websockets.  This offers maximum flexibility but requires more development effort.

* **Rasa Widget:** Utilizing the pre-built Rasa Widget, a React-based component that simplifies integration.  Clone the widget from https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0 and copy the contents of the `dist` folder into your web project.  This provides a ready-to-use chat interface with minimal setup.



<----------section---------->


### Rasa Connectors and Authentication

Rasa supports various connectors for integrating with different messaging platforms (Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Twilio, Microsoft Bot Framework, Cisco Webex Teams, RocketChat, Mattermost, Google Hangouts Chat).  See  https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/messaging-and-voice-channels/ for more information.

Rasa also allows for implementing authentication mechanisms to secure your chatbot and restrict access.  Websockets can be utilized for real-time, bidirectional communication between the chatbot and the frontend, enhancing the user experience.



<----------section---------->


### Building a Chatbot with Rasa (Detailed)

The `domain.yml` file defines the chatbot's knowledge base, including intents, entities, slots, actions, and responses.


**`domain.yml` Examples:**

* **Basic Responses:** Simple text replies triggered by specific intents.

* **Multiple Responses:** Defining variations for a single response, allowing the bot to choose randomly and create a more natural conversational flow.


* **Responses with Interactive Elements:**  Including buttons and images in responses to provide interactive options and richer user experience. The rendering of these elements depends on the chosen output channel.


**Intents and Entities:**

* **Intents:**  Represent the user's intentions and should correspond to the intents defined in the `nlu.yml` file.  It's recommended to start with a minimal set of intents and expand as needed based on user interactions.

* **Entities:**  Represent specific pieces of information within user utterances. Standard entities (dates, numbers, etc.) can be extracted using pre-built components in the NLU pipeline.  Custom entities can be defined and extracted using regular expressions, lookup tables, or machine learning models.


<----------section---------->


### The NLU File (`nlu.yml`)


The `nlu.yml` file is used to train the NLU model. It contains examples of user utterances categorized by intent, along with annotations for entities.  It can also include regular expressions, lookup tables, and synonyms to improve entity recognition.


**NLU Best Practices:**


* **Start Small:** Begin with a small, focused set of intents addressing the most common user goals.
* **Iterative Development:** Add and refine intents based on real user data collected during testing and deployment.
* **Entities, Not Intents:** Use entities to store specific information rather than creating separate intents for every variation.



<----------section---------->


### Stories, Rules, and Slots


* **`stories.yml`:** Stories are sequences of user intents and bot actions, used to train the dialogue management model.  They represent example conversation flows.  Stories can include OR statements to define different paths for the same intent and checkpoints to link to other stories, creating modular and reusable conversation flows.

* **`rules.yml`:**  Rules are hard-coded dialogue flows for specific scenarios. They are not used for training but are applied directly. They are suitable for short, predictable interactions.

* **Slots:** Slots are variables used to store information extracted from user input. They are defined in the `domain.yml` file and are often connected to entities.  Slot mappings define how slots are filled, including conditions based on intents and roles.  Slots can be used in responses to create dynamic and personalized messages.



<----------section---------->


### Pipeline Configuration (`config.yml`)

The `config.yml` file defines the NLU pipeline and dialogue policies.

* **NLU Pipeline:** A sequence of components used to process user messages. These components include tokenizers, featurizers, intent classifiers, and entity extractors. The specific components and their order determine how the NLU model interprets user input.

* **Dialogue Management Policies:** Strategies used by the bot to decide the next action.  Different policies can be combined, and their priority defines how decisions are made when multiple policies have similar confidence scores.


**Types of Dialogue Policies:**

* **Rule Policy:** Applies rules defined in `rules.yml`.
* **Memoization Policy:** Matches the current conversation state against the stories in `stories.yml`.
* **TED Policy (Transformer Embedding Dialogue):**  A neural network-based policy that learns from conversation histories.  Key parameters include `max_history` (number of previous conversational turns considered) and `epochs` (number of training iterations).



<----------section---------->


### Custom Actions


Custom actions extend the chatbot's functionality beyond simple responses. They are written in Python and can interact with external systems, databases, or APIs.


* **Action Server:**  Custom actions require an action server.  The action server endpoint needs to be configured in `endpoints.yml`.  Start the action server using `rasa run actions`.

### Enhanced Text: Building a Pizzeria Chatbot with Rasa

This document outlines the specifications and provides guidance for developing a chatbot designed to streamline pizzeria operations. The chatbot will allow users to access the menu and place orders, while also providing a logging mechanism for order tracking.

<----------section---------->

**Project Overview:**

This exercise focuses on building a functional chatbot for a pizzeria using the Rasa framework. The chatbot should be capable of handling the following user interactions:

* **Menu Request:** Users can request to see the pizzeria's menu.
* **Pizza Order:** Users can select and order a single pizza from the available options on the menu.  Note that this version of the chatbot does not handle beverage orders.
* **Order Confirmation and Logging:**  Upon confirmation of an order, the chatbot will record the order details, including the date, user ID, and the type of pizza ordered. This logging will be implemented using a custom Rasa action, providing a flexible way to integrate with various backend systems.
* **Web-Based Interface:** The chatbot should have a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, improving usability and accessibility.

<----------section---------->

**Development Hints:**

The following steps and tools are recommended for developing the chatbot:

* **Rasa Initialization:**
    * Create a project directory: `mkdir pizzaBot`
    * Navigate to the directory: `cd pizzaBot`
    * Initialize a Rasa project: `rasa init --no-prompt`.  The `--no-prompt` flag bypasses the interactive setup, streamlining the initialization process.

* **Server Configuration and Execution:**
    * Run the Rasa server with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled: `rasa run --cors "*"`. This allows the chatbot to be accessed from any web domain.
    * Run the Rasa actions server: `rasa run actions`. This server handles custom actions, such as logging order details.

* **Web Frontend Integration:** A pre-built web frontend is recommended for simplicity. The provided example utilizes a readily available widget:
    *  `https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/Widget2.0` This widget simplifies the integration of the Rasa chatbot into a web page.

* **Dummy Bot as Starting Point:** It is advisable to start with a basic, functional chatbot (a "dummy bot") and iteratively add features and complexity. This allows for easier debugging and incremental development.


<----------section---------->

**Example Conversation:**

The following dialogue illustrates a potential interaction flow between the user and the chatbot:

* **User:** can i have the menu?
* **Bot:** What kind of pizza would you like? We have Margherita, Pepperoni, Vegetarian, and SO Mushroom.
* **User:** Pepperoni
* **Bot:** You want a Pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?
* **User:** yes
* **Bot:** Great! Your Pepperoni pizza is on its way!

This example demonstrates the basic flow of requesting the menu, ordering a pizza, and confirming the order. This provides a starting point for developing more complex dialogue flows.

<----------section---------->

**Rasa and Chatbot Frameworks - Extended Context:**

The provided additional context discusses chatbot frameworks in general and Rasa specifically. Key takeaways regarding Rasa include:

* **Intent-Based Architecture:** Rasa employs an intent-based approach, focusing on understanding the user's intention (e.g., requesting the menu, placing an order) and responding with appropriate actions.
* **Components and Pipelines:**  Rasa utilizes a pipeline of components for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), including tokenization, featurization, and classification.  These components work together to process user input and extract relevant information.
* **Stories and Training:**  Rasa uses "stories" to define conversational flows and train its dialogue management model.  Stories are sequences of user intents and chatbot actions that represent example conversations.
* **Custom Actions:** Custom actions, written in Python, allow developers to extend Rasa's functionality, enabling integration with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs) and complex logic.
* **Configuration and Customization:** Rasa offers extensive configuration options, allowing developers to tailor the NLU pipeline and dialogue management to their specific needs.

The broader context emphasizes the importance of data-driven conversation design, iteratively improving the chatbot based on user interactions and feedback.  This involves analyzing conversation logs, identifying user pain points, and refining the chatbot's responses and logic. The context also highlights the ethical considerations of chatbot development, emphasizing the need for responsible AI practices and avoiding misleading or harmful interactions. This pizzeria chatbot project serves as a practical application of these concepts.

**FAISS**

### Introduzione
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) √® una libreria open-source sviluppata da Facebook AI Research per l'indicizzazione e la ricerca veloce di vettori ad alta dimensione. Il suo obiettivo principale √® rendere pi√π efficiente la ricerca della similarit√† tra vettori, un'operazione cruciale in molte applicazioni di intelligenza artificiale, come il recupero di informazioni, il riconoscimento delle immagini e i sistemi di raccomandazione.

### Perch√© FAISS √® importante?
Nei moderni sistemi di AI, si lavora spesso con enormi dataset di vettori, specialmente nell'ambito del deep learning. La ricerca esatta della similarit√† in uno spazio vettoriale pu√≤ essere computazionalmente proibitiva. FAISS fornisce algoritmi e strutture dati ottimizzate per eseguire ricerche approssimate in modo molto pi√π veloce rispetto a un approccio na√Øve basato su ricerche brute-force.

### Embedding e Similarit√† nell'NLP
FAISS lavora principalmente con **embedding**, rappresentazioni vettoriali di oggetti come testi, immagini o segnali audio. Nel contesto del **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, gli embedding sono vettori numerici che catturano la semantica delle parole, frasi o documenti. 

#### Generazione degli embedding
Nell'NLP, gli embedding sono generati attraverso modelli di apprendimento automatico come:
- **Word2Vec**: rappresenta le parole in base al loro contesto, utilizzando tecniche come Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) e Skip-gram.
- **GloVe**: costruisce embedding sulla base della co-occorrenza delle parole in un grande corpus testuale.
- **FastText**: un'estensione di Word2Vec che considera anche i sottotokens delle parole, utile per lingue con morfologia complessa.
- **BERT e Transformer-based models**: generano embedding contestualizzati che variano in base alla frase in cui la parola appare.
- **Sentence Transformers**: creano embedding per intere frasi, migliorando la ricerca semantica e la similarit√† testuale.

#### Metriche di Similarit√†
Una volta ottenuti gli embedding, FAISS permette di confrontarli utilizzando diverse metriche di similarit√†:
- **Similarit√† coseno**: misura l'angolo tra due vettori e viene ampiamente utilizzata per valutare la similarit√† semantica tra testi.
- **Distanza euclidea (L2)**: meno comune nell'NLP, utile quando gli embedding hanno distribuzioni spaziali significative.
- **Prodotto scalare (dot product)**: spesso usato nei modelli neurali per valutare l'affinit√† tra vettori.

#### Applicazioni nell'NLP
FAISS √® particolarmente utile in molteplici applicazioni NLP, tra cui:
- **Recupero di informazioni**: aiuta a trovare documenti o frasi simili in grandi dataset, come nella ricerca semantica.
- **Risoluzione della coreferenza**: identifica entit√† simili in un testo, associando riferimenti diversi a uno stesso concetto.
- **Sistemi di raccomandazione di testi**: suggerisce articoli, post o libri basandosi sulla similarit√† degli embedding.
- **Clustering e analisi dei topic**: raggruppa documenti con contenuti simili, utile per la categorizzazione automatica.
- **Traduzione automatica e allineamento testuale**: confronta frasi in lingue diverse per trovare corrispondenze tra segmenti di testo.

### Creazione e uso di un FAISS Index nell'NLP
FAISS fornisce API in Python per la gestione efficiente degli embedding testuali. Ecco un esempio per indicizzare e cercare frasi simili:

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Modello per generare embedding testuali
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

documents = [
    "Il gatto salta sul tavolo",
    "Un felino √® balzato sulla superficie",
    "Oggi il tempo √® splendido",
    "La partita di calcio √® stata emozionante"
]

# Creazione degli embedding
d = 384  # Dimensione del modello MiniLM
embeddings = np.array(model.encode(documents), dtype='float32')

# Creazione e popolamento dell'indice FAISS
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)
index.add(embeddings)

# Query per trovare frasi simili
query_text = "Il micio √® saltato sul mobile"
query_embedding = np.array([model.encode(query_text)], dtype='float32')
k = 2  # Numero di risultati

distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k)

# Output dei risultati
print("Frasi pi√π simili:")
for i in indices[0]:
    print(documents[i])
```

### Vantaggi di FAISS nell'NLP
- **Velocit√† di ricerca**: consente di trovare frasi simili in dataset di milioni di documenti in pochi millisecondi.
- **Scalabilit√†**: supporta grandi volumi di dati, ideale per motori di ricerca semantica e assistenti virtuali.
- **Flessibilit√†**: utilizzabile con vari modelli di embedding, adattandosi a diversi casi d'uso.

### Conclusione
FAISS √® un potente strumento per la ricerca di similarit√† in embedding testuali, rendendo possibili applicazioni avanzate nell'NLP. Grazie alla sua efficienza, √® usato in motori di ricerca semantica, chatbot e sistemi di raccomandazione testuale. L'integrazione con modelli come BERT e Sentence Transformers lo rende una scelta eccellente per chi lavora con grandi corpus di testo.
