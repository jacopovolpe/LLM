ANTONIO GRECO 
Antonio Greco graduated with honors in Computer Engineering in 2014 from the University of 
Salerno (Italy). In March 2018, he earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Information 
Engineering from the same university. In March 2020, he became an RTD/A Researcher (SSD 
ING-INF/05 "Information Processing Systems") at the Department of Information and Electrical 
Engineering and Applied Mathematics (DIEM) at the University of Salerno, where he has been an 
RTD/B Researcher since November 2022. Within the same department, he has served as 
Delegate for Student Orientation since November 2022 and has been a member of the Ph.D. 
Board in Information Engineering since May 2024. 
For the department, he has taught various courses, including Logic Networks (SSD ING-INF/05, 
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering), Autonomous Vehicle Driving (SSD ING-INF/05, 
Master's Degree in Computer Engineering), Web Software Technologies (SSD ING-INF/05, 
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering), Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity (SSD ING
INF/05, Master's Degree in Computer Engineering), Robotics for E-Health (SSD ING-INF/05, 
Master's Degree in Digital Health and Bioinformatics Engineering), System and Network Security 
(SSD ING-INF/05, Master's Degree in Computer Engineering), Artificial Vision (SSD ING-INF/05, 
Master's Degree in Computer Engineering), and Natural Language Processing and Large 
Language Models (SSD ING-INF/05, Master's Degree in Computer Engineering). Since the 
2021/2022 academic year, he has also taught the course Advanced Machine Learning as part of 
the accredited Ph.D. program in Information Engineering (D.M. 226/2021). 
Since 2014, he has been a member of the MIVIA Lab (Machines for Intelligent Video, Image, and 
Audio recognition) at the University of Salerno’s DIEM, a group with a strong focus on 
international collaborations. His research primarily focuses on Computer Vision and Pattern 
Recognition, specifically on the design, implementation, and optimization of real-time 
computer vision and deep learning algorithms (e.g., gender recognition, age estimation, 
ethnicity recognition, emotion analysis, fire detection, anomaly detection, people counting, 
object tracking, and audio event recognition) for data acquired from static devices (smart 
cameras, microphones) or moving devices (drones, robots, autonomous vehicles). These 
activities are often conducted in collaboration with European research groups, particularly at 
the University of Malta, the University of Groningen (Netherlands), and the University of Twente 
(Netherlands), where he has spent a total of nine months as a Visiting Researcher (January
April 2020 and August 2021–February 2022). At Twente, he collaborated with the Data 
Management and Biometrics Group within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, 
and Computer Science. 
In recent years, he has organized several Special Issues for international journals, including an 
issue of the Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing titled “Ambient 
Understanding for Mobile Autonomous Robots (AutoRob)," an issue of Pattern Recognition on 
“From Bench to the Wild: Recent Advances in Computer Vision Methods (WILD-VISION)," and 
an issue of Pattern Analysis and Applications on “Pedestrian Attribute Recognition and Person 
Re-Identification." As of March 2024, he is an Associate Editor for Pattern Analysis and 
Applications and serves as a reviewer for over 25 international journals. 
Antonio Greco has presented his scientific work at more than ten international conferences and 
has served as Contest Chair at various events. Notably, he organized the Guess the Age (GTA) 
Contest 2021 at the International Conference on Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns 
(CAIP), co-organized the ONFIRE 2023 contest at the International Conference on Image 
Analysis and Processing (ICIAP), and co-organized the Pedestrian Attributes Recognition (PAR) 
Contest 2023 at CAIP. Additionally, he served on the Local Committee for the International 
Workshop on Graph-based Representations (GBR) in Capri, Italy (May 16–18), the International 
Conference on Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns (CAIP) in Salerno, Italy (September 2
6, 2019), the IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation 
Management (CogSIMA) in Salerno, Italy (June 6–10, 2022), and the GBR Workshop in Salerno 
(September 6–8). In 2021, he was an Invited Speaker at the CogSIMA Challenge Problems 
Workshop at the IEEE CogSIMA Conference, delivering a talk titled “Adding Awareness to AI 
Systems.” 
In national and international research projects, he has served as the scientific lead of the local 
research unit at DIEM for the PON ARS01_01226 project PerMedNet – Personalized Medicine for
